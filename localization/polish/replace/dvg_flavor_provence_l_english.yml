 je_valois_claim: "Reclaim the French Throne"
 je_valois_claim_reason: "Ever since losing the Hundred Years' War, the House of Valois is only a fraction of what it once was, ruling the what is essentially to rump state of[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. However, if Paris can be retaken then [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] can be known as the "King of France" rather than a "King in France". "
 je_valois_claim_goal: "Retake Paris and most of the other French hommelands."
 
 je_medici_claim: "Reclaim the Tuscan Throne"
 je_medici_claim_reason: "The Medicis and their descendants are the rightful rulers of Tuscany and we must restore them to their position."
 je_medici_claim_goal: "Retake Tuscany."

 je_occitan_republic: "Embracing Occitan Republicanism"
 je_occitan_republic_reason: "If the Valois-Medicis are no longer in power, it will become unreasonable for us to pursue the notion of claiming France and Italy for ourselves. Instead, we will focus on embracing a more local identity, and stand for the idea of all cultures having their own nation."

 je_destroy_provence: "Goodbye Valois"
 je_destroy_provence_reason: "Despite losing the Hundred Years' War, the Valois still hold onto the title of "Kings in France" and are fostering sepratists within our country as part of their "divide and conquer" strategy. It is time we end any power they have once and for all."

 dvg_provence.1.t: "The King in France"
 dvg_provence.1.d:  "The French Wars of Succession was nothing short of a disaster for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] dynasty."
 dvg_provence.1.f: "The combination of unlucky factors  such as the death of Jeanne d’Arc in 1431 and [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BRG').GetName] remaining with the House of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_DUA').GetRuler.GetLastName] with the Treaty of Arras in 1435 and the disastrous defeat at Vichy in 1471 helped contribute to the total annihilation of the Armagnac party. Reduced to its holdings in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], Charles VIII was forced to sign the Treaty of Rome in 1498  confirming his current domains and the title of “King in France” and Duke of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] (as Charles IV) in exchange for recognizing the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_DUA').GetRuler.GetLastName] as Kings of France. Due to being reduced to a rump state, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] now finds itself under the influence of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ARA').GetName] thanks to the common animosity shared towards the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_DUA').GetName]."
 dvg_provence.1.a: "The French throne might be lost but it is not forgotten."
 
 dvg_provence.2.t: "The Exiled Tuscans"
 dvg_provence.2.d:  "From 1494 with the marriage of Charles IV to Contessina Beatrice de Medici,  a daughter of the last Gonfaloniere and first Duke of Tuscany, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has played a significant role in Italian affairs."
 dvg_provence.2.f: "After the failure of the German Revolution, Italian revolutionaries rose up in Florence in 1804 and ended the Personal Union of the Duchy of Tuscany and the Kingdom in France that had existed since the ascension of Giovanni Battista de [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PRO').GetRuler.GetLastName] to the throne of Provence in 1710. Although they were successful in helping to contain the Republic to [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_TUS').GetName] they were unable to restore the personal union. With the dawn of the post-Wenceslausian era, the Valois of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] are now divided on their intentions. Do they continue the fight against the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_DUA').GetRuler.GetLastName] to reclaim their birthright? Or do they go against their masters and seek to unite the Italian Peninsula as successors to the legacy of Charles d’Anjou and Lorenzo de’ Medici."
 dvg_provence.2.a: "Our hold in Tuscany might be lost but it is not forgotten."
 
 dvg_provence.3.t: "Strange Letter"
 dvg_provence.3.d:  "We have received a letter from the Duchy of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PAR').GetName] requesting we appoint a member of the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PAR').GetRuler.GetLastName] Dynasty as general."
 dvg_provence.3.f: "The individual in question is Antonio de [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PAR').GetRuler.GetLastName], an abnormally young pick for the requested position but considered to be an "absolute genius". The only reason they supposedly sent him was that "his ambitions would not be suited for a duchy that is unlikely to survive the next liberal uprising". Your choice, King."
 dvg_provence.3.a: "An absolute genius? We have no reason not to hire him."
 dvg_provence.3.b: "An ambitious fool. He will have to look elsewhere."
 
 dvg_provence.4.t: "Showdown in Lucca"
 dvg_provence.4.d:  "For centuries, the House of Valois has claimed both France and vast swathes of Italy even though they only controlled Provence. The recent [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PRO').GetRuler.GetLastName] seizure of Tuscany – and the pugnacious nature of the “King in France” – has sparked a crisis between them and the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PAR').GetRuler.GetLastName]-ruled [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_LUC').GetName]."
 dvg_provence.4.f: "The Lucchesi ambassador explained that the Provençals, after a diplomatic row with the duchy,  are now attempting to press their old claim to it. Obviously  Provençal expansion in Italy would be a disaster  but ability to prevent it hinges upon use of the Pope’s influence, especially our enclave in the Comtats of Avignon and Venaissin."
 dvg_provence.4.a: "Let us pray."
 dvg_provence.4.b: "Who cares?"
 
 dvg_provence.5.t: "The Lucchesi Crisis"
 dvg_provence.5.d:  "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PRO').GetRuler.GetLastName] conquest of Tuscany was bad enough but their aggression towards [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_LUC').GetName] threatens to draw the whole of Italy into war."
 dvg_provence.5.f: "If we do not take a stand against the foreigners then the states of the north may soon pass into foreign dominion once more. The Holy Father and his advisors have put their minds together and developed a plan to contain them. We shall first demand that the Provençals stand down and concede to the illegitimacy of their claim to [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_LUC').GetName] effectively dooming any chance of the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PRO').GetRuler.GetLastName]s continuing their Italian expansion. If they refuse  then we shall excommunicate their king and set the restoration of an independent Tuscany as their penance. Meanwhile, we will organize a coalition of Italian states to prepare to oppose Provence on the battlefield."
 dvg_provence.5.a: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PRO').GetRuler.GetLastName]s must be expelled."
 dvg_provence.5.b: "I never liked [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_LUC').GetName] much anyway."
 
 dvg_provence.6.t: "The Pope Dismisses Our Claim!"
 dvg_provence.6.d: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PAP').GetName] has long opposed any effort by our great dynasty to expand its power within Italy and they show no sign of changing any time soon."
 dvg_provence.6.f: "At the urging of the traitorous [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_LUC').GetRuler.GetLastName],  the Pope has declared our claim to [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_LUC').GetName] to be illegitimate! This announcement has already stirred popular agitation between Catholics and secularists. While it seems that His “Holiness” may be willing to tolerate our presence within Tuscany alone accepting his intervention would amount to giving up all further aims in Italy. If we press on  then Pope [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PAP').GetRuler.GetFirstName] will likely escalate the situation. Excommunication and a military confrontation could both be on the table."
 dvg_provence.6.a: "How many divisions does he even have?"
 dvg_provence.6.b: "Perhaps we are not meant to rule Italy."
 
 dvg_provence.7.t: "The Unthinkable Reply"
 dvg_provence.7.d: "Provence has flatly rejected any attempt to annul their claims! This unprecedented defiance has sent all of Roma into an uproar."
 dvg_provence.7.f: "If the Provençals will not see reason  then we must resort to harsher measures. His Holiness has now proclaimed the excommunication of the "King in France", placing Provence under interdict  and has demanded the immediate evacuation of all Provençal possessions in Italy. If they refuse once again then we will have no choice but to make manifest the wrath of God upon them."
 dvg_provence.7.a: "How dare they question the Lord’s representative on Earth!"
 
 dvg_provence.8.t: "The Papal Ultimatum"
 dvg_provence.8.d: "Our rejection of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PAP').GetName] intervention was not received well in Roma. Pope [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PAP').GetRuler.GetFirstName] has now placed the Kingdom of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] under interdict."
 dvg_provence.8.f: "While the announcement was dressed up in flowery language  this is obviously an extortive measure to compel us to abandon Italy. If we do not wish to see Tuscany fall under [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PAP').GetName] control  and our ambitions in Italy die an ignominious death then we shall inflame the Catholic and Italian worlds with our defiance. It is likely that Pope [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PAP').GetRuler.GetFirstName] would muster a coalition of Italian states against us – none of their rulers seem to realize the benefits of enlightened [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PRO').GetRuler.GetLastName] rule. As a precaution we would also need to pressure the Public Council of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_AVN').GetName] to surrender to us in order to shore up our defenses against the Papacy."
 dvg_provence.8.a: "The Die Ist Cast."
 dvg_provence.8.b: "This was all a misunderstanding."
 
 dvg_provence.9.t: "The Treaty of Paris"
 dvg_provence.9.d: "The Plantagenets have been forced out of all major cities in France  and have proven utterly unable to dislodge us. We believe that we can now force them to the negotiating table to acknowledge our rightful ownership of France in exchange for keeping the rest of their domain."
 dvg_provence.9.f: "Soon,  our king shall be brought to the royal cathedral at Reims to be crowned King of France. It is a fitting irony – as they once exiled us to Provence  so now we shall exile them to England. The House of Valois has prevailed!"
 dvg_provence.9.a: "The Hundred Years War is truly over!"

 dvg_provence.10.t: "Triumph in Tuscany"
 dvg_provence.10.d: "Our invasion of Tuscany was a risky gamble but luck seems to finally be returning to the House of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName]."
 dvg_provence.10.f: "The Tuscans have been reconquered and for better or worse their elites have accepted our return. Of course the first order of business was to reassure all of the local lords that they’d be able to keep their powers and privileges so long as they cooperated. The acquisition of Tuscany opens up the rest of Italy to our grand dynasty and the methods of integration we have practiced here will go a long way towards helping us bring more of Italy under [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] rule."
 dvg_provence.10.a: "Italy shall belong to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName]s!"
 
 dvg_provence.11.t: "The End of the Hundred Years War"
 dvg_provence.11.d: "For Centuries, the House of Valois-Medici has barricaded themselves within Provence plotting against us..."
 dvg_provence.11.f: "as if they were still a serious rival rather than a pathetic remnant of their former might. France belongs to the House of Plantagenet and no one else! The time has come to conclude the absurd charade of the “King in France” and put an end to the feud between our houses once and for all."
 dvg_provence.11.a: "Provence has lived long enough!"

 dvg_provence.12.t: "Trouble in Avignon"
 dvg_provence.12.d: "Our unsanctioned elimination of Valois-Medici Provence has greatly angered His Holiness the Pope."
 dvg_provence.12.f: "Provence existed in a state of uneasy equilibrium with the Papacy and its Duchy of Avignon. The Pope and the Medicis may not have been on friendly terms but Provence kept Avignon stable. Now the violent destruction of the Provençal nation has plunged Avignon into turmoil and the duchy is likely to collapse. Already reports are coming in of Provençal agitators calling for the storming of Avignon and many ecclesiastical personnel have already been evacuated to Roma or Turin. If Avignon falls then the Pope may take extreme measures to protect his influence in Italy."
 dvg_provence.12.a: "It's just one city!"

  dvg_restore_tuscany:0 "Restore Order in Etruria"
  dvg_restore_tuscany_desc:0 "The Republic of Etruria is the threat to the Italian Order. While Aragon is reluctant to go to war against them  we haven't forgotten our right to the grand duchy of Tuscany. The various monarchs of North Italy would not react to this declaration because we would erase a threat to their personal power but Aragon might be angered by our demonstration of force."

  dvg_reclaim_france:0 "Challenge the Usurpers"
  dvg_reclaim_france_desc:0 "Having liberated Occitania  we now must turn our eyes to the north. The core lands of France are currently held by false pretenders a vestige of the corrupt and decadent Plantagenet regime. The time has come to sweep them away and restore our rightful rule! Soon we shall be crowning our sovereign King of France at the Reims cathedral!
  
  dvg_claim_lucca:0 "Claim Lucca"
  dvg_claim_lucca_desc:0 "Now that we have Tuscany, it is time to consolidate our claims over Italy."
    
  dvg_provence_protestant:0 "Reject Catholicism"
  dvg_provence_protestant_desc:0 "Now that our government has been alienated by the Pope and the royal family excommunicated, maybe it is time to stop supporting the Catholic church and be more Protestant instead."
    
  dvg_annex_avignon:0 "Annex Avignon"
  dvg_annex_avignon_desc:0 "Now that we are war with the Pope, we should stop harboring the Avignon Papacy."
  
  dvg_transalpina:0 "Merge the Crowns of France and Italy"
  dvg_transalpina_desc:0 "For generations the House of Valois-Medici has claimed the rulership of both France and Italy yet held neither. Now, we are masters of both! A lesser dynasty might divide our new empire between two Valois heirs  but we shall not repeat the mistakes of partitioned inheritance which have haunted the Western world since Charlemagne’s death. If France and England could be tied into one realm then surely  two regions even more alike in culture and temperament.  may be joined together as one! The Dual Monarchy of England and France is dead. Long live the union of France and Italy!"

  dvg_promote_occitania:0 "Promote Occitan Nationalism"
  dvg_promote_occitania_desc:0 "As we harbor the "King in France", we can publish propaganda serving them and give them to agents who easily cross the border to bolster French and Occitan nationalism under the banner the Valois, who should be the trule rulers of France. The Anglois government probably won't like this though."
