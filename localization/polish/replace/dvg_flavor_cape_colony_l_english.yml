 je_cap_moderate: "Regaining Control"
 je_cap_moderate_reason: "The failures of the Viceroy have shown us that you cannot create a profitable colony while opressing your colonists. If we are to have any hope of regaining control of the Cape we must first calm our current situation and show the rebelling Geus that they have more to gain working with us, than by fighting a war of independence."
 je_cap_moderate_goal: "We must reduce agitation in the Geuzen population and coax them into returning to work. If agitation gets too high the colony will not survive."
 je_no_geus_agitation_tt: "To successfully appease the Geuzen population"
 #je_max_geus_agitation_tt: "If we cannot quell the unrest in the Geuzen population the colony will collapse."
 je_cap_militarist: "Crushing the Geus"
 je_cap_militarist_reason: "The failures of the Viceroy have shown us that you cannot create a profitable colony with a weak, decadent leader in command. If we are to have any hope of reclaiming the Cape we must show these beggars that there is no alternative to our rule. Pockets of rebellion wil be crushed and the upstarts that have claimed statelets ourside our borders will be dealt with. The Geus will know that they are our colonial subjects, nothing more."
 je_cap_militarist_goal: "We must crush all pockets of Geuzen resistance. Failing to supress the Geus will be the downfall of the colony."
 je_no_geus_supression_tt: "The future of the colony depends on keeping the Geus in their place"
 je_max_geus_supression_tt: "We must crush the pathetic Geuzen militias that contunue to resist our rule"

 dvg_cape_colony.1.t: "The Dissolution of the Cape"
 dvg_cape_colony.1.d: "Having lost the bulk of our military during the Geuzen rebellions, the remaining part of the cape under control of Burgundy is in total dissaray"
 dvg_cape_colony.1.f: "The humiliation of losing a war to the Viceroy's bastard son, the death the only heir and the destruction of his military; the Burgundian crown was left with no choice but to dissolve the viceroyalty and establish a directly appointed colonial administration. " 
 dvg_cape_colony.1.a: "The Geus seem to be getting louder by the day"
 
 #Appointing the Governor
 dvg_cape_colony.2.t: "Appointment of the Governor"
 dvg_cape_colony.2.d: "When the new colonial administration was established, Brugundy sent an administrator, Gillebert Pierlot, to act as the interim governor while the new administration was establishing itself. Now that all of the positions in the government are filled, Burgundy must decide who should lead the reconquest of the cape. Who do we recommend?"
 dvg_cape_colony.2.f: "Gillebert Pierlot has proven himself to be a competent administrator. Instituting a 'government from afar' policy towards the Geus and native Africans; affording them a generous degree of autonomy. He believes that giving these communities nothing to resist will eventually result in them returning to work and engaging with the Burgundian economy. On the other hand; Commander Regnault Courvoisier is a prime military condidate to fill the governorship. He advocates for swift and violent reprisals against the rebellious Geuzen people, and aggresive settler colonisation to secure Burgundian control. Having already drawn up plans to recapture Ylnerdam from Aloysius, he is the favoured choice among hardliners in the Burgundian court." 
 dvg_cape_colony.2.a: "The moderate Pierlot"
 dvg_cape_colony.2.b: "The militarist Courvoisier"

 #Burgundy accepts the moderate
 dvg_cape_colony.3.t: "Burgundy accepts our recommendation"
 dvg_cape_colony.3.d: "The Burgundian crown has accepted our recommendation to keep Pierlot as governor"
 dvg_cape_colony.3.f: "In a ceremony inside the palace of the former Duke, Pierlot was oficially confirmed as the first governor of the Cape. In his speech he discussed an amnesty for rebelling Geuzen settlements, extending diplomatic recognition toward the republic of Vryland, as well as offering protection to the Native tribes of the Cape." 
 dvg_cape_colony.3.a: "Who says colonisation has to be violent?"

 #Burgundy rejects the moderate
 dvg_cape_colony.4.t: "Burgundy rejects our recommendation!"
 dvg_cape_colony.4.d: "Regnault Courvoisier arrived today to deliver Brugundy's response, in which Pierlot recieved a commendation from the crown for his service; shortly before being dismissed as governor"
 dvg_cape_colony.4.f: "While inspecting the palace of the former duke, Courvoisier made several comments insulting Pierlot's government and masculinity, before comandeering the palace and ordering that the breurecrats within it be relocated elsewhere in Ville du Cap. In an extravagant ceremony outside his palace the following day, Regnault gave an hour-long speech declaring that the Geus will pay for resisting the Burgundian throne, and that all of Southern Africa is destined for Burgundian rule" 
 dvg_cape_colony.4.a: "The Geus won't stand a chance"

 #Burgundy accepts the militarist
 dvg_cape_colony.5.t: "Burgundy accepts our recommendation"
 dvg_cape_colony.5.d: "Regnault Courvoisier arrived today to relieve Pierlot from duty"
 dvg_cape_colony.5.f: "While inspecting the palace of the former duke, Courvoisier made several backhanded comments regarding Pierlot's 'dainty' lodgings, before comandeering the palace and ordering that the breurecrats within it be relocated elsewhere in Ville du Cap. In an extravagant ceremony outside his palace the following day, Regnault gave an hour-long speech declaring that the Geus will pay for resisting the Burgundian throne, and that all of Southern Africa is destined for Burgundian rule" 
 dvg_cape_colony.5.a: "The Geus won't stand a chance"

 #Burgundy rejects the militarist
 dvg_cape_colony.6.t: "Burgundy rejects our recommendation!"
 dvg_cape_colony.6.d: "Fearing that a firmer hand will only inflame the cape further, the Crown has decided to keep Courvoisier on the mainland"
 dvg_cape_colony.6.f: "In a ceremony inside the palace of the former Duke, Pierlot was officially confirmed as the first governor of the Cape. In a rather awkard speech to the beurecrats that recommended his removal he discussed an amnesty for rebelling Geuzen settlements, extending diplomatic recognition toward the republic of Vryland, as well as offering protection to the Native tribes of the Cape." 
 dvg_cape_colony.6.a: "It probably wasn't personal"

 #Leeuwin infiltrates mosselbai
 dvg_cape_colony.7.t: "Leeuwin Infiltrates Mosselbai!"
 dvg_cape_colony.7.d: "The underhanded bastards in Leeuwin have apparently been smuggling weapons across the border and stashing them in Mosselbai."
 dvg_cape_colony.7.f: "Now they have initiated a suprise attack against our garrison and are rousing the current Geuzen inhabitants of Mosselbai to take up arms against us. By the time our reinforcements arrive the port will have defected to Leeuwin. We can only hope that our progress in placating the Geuzen population has been enough to deter the inhabitants from taking up arms." 
 dvg_cape_colony.7.a: "Our efforts weren't enough..."
 dvg_cape_colony.7.b: "They remained loyal!"

 #Geuzen militia caught crossing into Leeuwin
 dvg_cape_colony.100.t: "Geuzen Militia Caught Crossing Into Leeuwin"
 dvg_cape_colony.100.d: "Our guards at the border with Leeuwin have detained a small group of Kommandos trying to cross the border. They are well supplied and many of them are armed."
 dvg_cape_colony.100.f: "Our current border policy dictates that their weapons are to be confiscated and they are to be turned back to where they came from. Though this will only keep disgruntled and radical militia members within our borders. Allowing them to slip through, while in breach of policy, will at least leave us rid of these rabble-rousers." 
 dvg_cape_colony.100.a: "Enforce the hard border"
 dvg_cape_colony.100.b: "Let them cross"

 #New Geuzen settlement
 dvg_cape_colony.101.t: "New Geuzen Settlement"
 dvg_cape_colony.101.d: "We have recieved word that a group of Geuzen settlers in Ville du Cap are preparing a convoy."
 dvg_cape_colony.101.f: "They are supposedly planning on travelling north-east to found a new settlement. This area is known to house several rebellious Geuzen hideouts and they may indend to aid them. Preventing them from leaving may aid in starving out rebellious enclaves, though it would certainly anger our geuzen population." 
 dvg_cape_colony.101.a: "Let them go"
 dvg_cape_colony.101.b: "Stop them"

 #monument to the Viceroy
 dvg_cape_colony.102.t: "Monument to the Viceroy"
 dvg_cape_colony.102.d: "While the Viceroy is gone, monuments to him and his predecessors are still dotted throughout Ville du Cap."
 dvg_cape_colony.102.f: "Some Geuzen citizens are particularly offended by a monument commemorating the defeat of a minor Geuzen rebellion some decades ago. It has been vandalized several times in recent months and now locals from the area are demanding that the statue be removed entirely." 
 dvg_cape_colony.102.a: "As they wish"
 dvg_cape_colony.102.b: "Assign guards to prevent further vandalization of the monuments"
 dvg_cape_colony.102.c: "The Viceroyalty is no more, replace it with a statue of ME!"

 #divide and conquer
 dvg_cape_colony.103.t: "Divide and Conquer"
 dvg_cape_colony.103.d: "Despite our 'endearing' name for them, not all Geuzen inhabitants of the cape are impoverished. Some of them have benefited greatly from their status as colonials."
 dvg_cape_colony.103.f: "These people are smart enough to know that they are better off under our administration than self rule, and many maintain connections within the Geuzen community in the Cape. By greasing a few palms we may be able to acquire information regarding rebellious geuzen activity, allwing us to distrupt it before it gains traction. But convincing them to sell out their friends and family won't come cheap..." 
 dvg_cape_colony.103.a: "Find some snitches"
 dvg_cape_colony.103.b: "We can't afford it"

 #increase patrols
 dvg_cape_colony.104.t: "Enforcing the Curfew"
 dvg_cape_colony.104.d: "Ville du Cap is currently under curfew, to prevent meeting of Geuzen militias under the cover of darkness."
 dvg_cape_colony.104.f: "Nevertheless, these clandestine meetings continue. We believe that our patrols are stretched too thin and that their patterns have been recongnised by the militias they are trying to distrupt, making them less effective week by week. Increasing the frequency of patrols should be able to keep the rebels scattered enough to deter further organising. But it won't be cheap." 
 dvg_cape_colony.104.a: "Establish more patrols"
 dvg_cape_colony.104.b: "We don't have the resources"

 #moderate success
 dvg_cape_colony.110.t: "Strangers No More"
 dvg_cape_colony.110.d: "Over the last few months a strange calm has fallen over Ville du Cap, yet the streets are still bustling, and our guards have reported fewer engagements than ever."
 dvg_cape_colony.110.f: "It is now safe to say that organied resistance against us has dissapeared. After years of careful manouvering and patience the Geuzen population of the Cape no longer see themselves as an opressed people, but as equal subjects." 
 dvg_cape_colony.110.a: "Now to bring the rest back to the fold"

 #moderate failure
 dvg_cape_colony.111.t: "Collapse of the Cape"
 dvg_cape_colony.111.d: "We have failed"
 dvg_cape_colony.111.f: "All our attempts at concilliation were for naught. The Geuzen population are armed, emboldened, and are surrounding Ville du Cap. We ahve neither the resources or support to maintain our authority."
