  dvg_danubian_unification.10.t:0 "The Salzburg Revolution"
  dvg_danubian_unification.10.d:0 "Our rule in Salzburg has become unstable."
  dvg_danubian_unification.10.f:0 "With the recent tensions in both Bavaria and Austria, liberal revolutionaries have flocked to Salzburg, spreading their rhetoric and demanding either massive reform or outright republican revolution. Now these radicals have sprung into action. After a recent Mass in which the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg lambasted the liberal movement, a protest occurred outside of the Residenz palace during a meeting of Salzburger religious authorities. Before the Prince-Archbishop could summon the city guards, several revolutionaries - who, having learned from past street battles, came armed - overpowered the local security and let the crowd into the Residenz. The Prince-Archbishop was soon lynched in front of his own palace and the rest of the clergy have been imprisoned within the Hohensalzburg Fortress, while revolutionaries have declared a new republican city-state. Both Austrian and Bavarian authorities have accused one another of supporting the rebels, and a confrontation between our nations over the Salzburg crisis is now imminent."
