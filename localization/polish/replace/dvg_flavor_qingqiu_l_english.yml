 je_qingqiu_reform_into_cooler_federation:0 "Reforming the Federation"
 je_qingqiu_reform_into_cooler_federation_reason:0 "Through these reforms we will take control of the provincial armies and curb their corrupt ways by delegating more power to the people, this will allow our federation to prosper!"
 je_qingqiu_reform_into_unitary_state:0 "A New Era as a Unitary State"
 je_qingqiu_reform_into_unitary_state_reason:0 "The federal system has worked well in the past, yet the governors don't have the interests of the people in mind, by removing them from the equation we will be able to serve the people directly!"
 je_qingqiu_the_matter_of_the_leages:0 "League Matters"
 
 je_qingqiu_the_matter_of_the_leages_reason:0 "The Leagues of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], represented in the government as the united League of Traders, Shipwrights & Warehouses, rife with internal competition and many commercial ventures across the country, the Leagues are centralised around major trading cities in the country yet often extend their influence to the very frontiers of Qingqiu! This brings both benefits and pitfalls to the government, with their chokehold on almost all commercial aspects of the country, their business is our business too."

 je_mengzi:0 "The Resurgence of Mengzism"
 je_mengzi_desc:0 "Mengzism, or Mencianism, is a philosophical system based on the teachings of Mencius (Mengzi), a 4th-century BCE Chinese philosopher who is one of the most famous Confucian thinkers. Mengzism emphasizes the inherent goodness of human nature and the importance of cultivating this innate virtue through education, self-reflection, and moral development. It promotes the idea that people are born with a sense of compassion and righteousness, which can be nurtured to achieve moral excellence. Mengzism also advocates for benevolent governance, arguing that rulers should lead with virtue and prioritize the welfare of the people."
 
 je_fang_hu: "The Sanctioned Marshal"
 je_fang_hu_reason: "Yeng Futing himself tried to shape the country as he saw fit as the First Speaker but was out-maneuvered and left to conquer Hawaii. His efforts brought the decentralized archipelago under the rule of a wealthy Qingqiuese elite. As a Chinese-supermacist, he hopes to shape the archipelago in his own intersts."

 qingqiu_federation.1.d:0 "The Status of the Federation"
 qingqiu_federation.1.f:0 "The Federation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is by no means a well-functioning federation. Our provinces have a great level of autonomy, having differing laws and even their own armies, making governance from  difficult. The provinces are actively working against our federation, making it tough to pass laws and taking a share of the taxes imposed on our people for themselves! However the federation is not without benefits, with our long history of federalism, beginning in the 1600s, we have found what works for the Qingqiuan people. Yet now the question remains; We must reform, but how? Do we reform our federation, or begin a new era as a unitary state?"

 qingqiu_federation.3.f:0 "After years of careful manouvers within our government, pitting the provinces against each other and even considerate military reform in order to further our cause and prolong the success of the Federation! Now after years of struggles we have finally finished with our reforms, the provinces are now demilitarised and serve the people rather than the governors, our people no longer view themselves as Sanbaoers or Dayanites and instead see themselves as Qingqiuian! Now that we have bought stability to the federationn, we can continue onwards and face the enemies that dare threaten our Federation!"

Finally our nation will be stable, we have the oportunity to liberalise and progress, finally the Qingqiuian people won't need to bend the knee to corrupt governors and endure thier backwards ways. Direct governance from Sanbao begins now, in the name of the people!"

 qingqiu_flood.15.tt:0 "We can only hope that this is enough"

 qingqiu_federation.5.d:0 "After many weeks of hard and grueling work by our valiant builders, we've finally completed the railway across Dayan, linking Changfeng and Sanbao!"
 qingqiu_federation.5.f:0 "Weaving through the mountains, past the gold fields of Dayan and along the Grey River, stretches a band of wood and steel, seemlingly endless should you stand in the middle of it. As the first train begins its journey from Sanbao to Changfeng, our railway builders sit back in Sanbao, proudly looking down the line as the joint Golden Sleeper monuments are built in Sanbao and Changfeng. Now eager passangers and prospectors in Sanbao stand at the platform waiting for the next train to bring them to the goldfields out west, creating a new wave of migration in Qingqiu!"
 qingqiu_federation.5.a:0 "Onwards to Changfeng!"

 dvg_hawaii.1.t:0 "The Voyage of the Dingyuan"
 dvg_hawaii.1.d:0 "Sitting isolated in the Pacific Ocean, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] sits in a vulnerable position."
 dvg_hawaii.1.f:0 "Marshal [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] is the rightful leader of both our humble archipelago of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetName]. Beginning as a general in the Qingqiuese War of Independence he led his armies to victory and secured independence for his homeland. Naturally he was soon elected to the position of First Speaker and worked towards strengthening [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetName]. However he was backstabbed by his rivals and soon found himself under investigation and his position as First Speaker under threat. Before he could be charged with anything he embarked to the islands of Hawaii at the time known as Jarlsbergs・yene in Europe and which was going through its own unification war. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] brought peace and stability to his new realm of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] which he has governed ever since. One of his first decrees was an embargo against traitorous [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetName] but last night a [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetAdjective] ship, the Dinggyuan, attempted to smuggle goods into [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]! Fortunately the virtuous Fleet-in-Exile drove them off but this is yet another reminder that we must not forget our dangerous position."
 dvg_hawaii.1.a:0 "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetName], we have not forgotten you!

 dvg_hawaii.2.t:0 "House [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_iolani').GetLastName] Escapes!"
 dvg_hawaii.2.d:0 "."
 dvg_hawaii.2.f:0 "The Kalanikupule Family, long the rulers of the island of Maui, like most native Hawaiian dynasties, reduced to mere figureheads under the close eye of the Marshall・s forces. Kept under house arrest and tight surveillance except during major ceremonies control of the islands・ ・ruling・ families strengthened Futing・s rule. It appears that these security measures have finally failed. Last night, after what was according to an interrogated household servant, months of planning the Kalanikupules gathered their most precious belongings and subdued the guards posted to the night watch of their state-furnished palace. Stealing out into the night they were met at the shore by a launch from a ship which carried them away and allowed them to make a rapid escape before the Navy could even be notified. According to the lighthouse keeper who reported the incident the ship that bore them was flying the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] flag! This has led to rumors swirling that the whole thing was a [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] plot!"
 dvg_hawaii.2.a:0 "Blasted Scandinavians!"

 dvg_hawaii.3.t:0 "Death of the Marshall"
 dvg_hawaii.3.d:0 "As Feng Yuting passes away, another one of his ilk takes his place."
 dvg_hawaii.3.f:0 " [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], Great Marshal of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetName] and the islands of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has died. Beginning as the youngest general in [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetName] he secured his country's independence from the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_JAP').GetAdjective]. However, the resistance to his centralization forced him into exile. He fled to the islands of Hawai'i at the time known as Jarlsbergs・yene in Europe and which was going through its own unification wars. The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetAdjective]  general decimated the warring chiefs and their retinues establishing an oligarchy where only the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetAdjective]  officers had power. Futing claimed to be the only true ruler of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetName] although no one took him seriously. His unopposed rule lasted more than 40 years and already it seems that both the native Hawaians who have become increasingly radicalized due to the harsh treatments imposed by the Chinese oligarchy and the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetAdjective] settlers want some change in the islands. One wonders how the designated successor of Yeng, Zhang Chen, will handle this new era."
 dvg_hawaii.3.a:0 "Another drama in the Pacific."

 dvg_hawaii.4.t:0 "Invite [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_FGH').GetRuler.GetFullName] back?"
 dvg_hawaii.4.d:0 "As our country prepares to attack [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_FGH').GetName], its leader - [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_FGH').GetRuler.GetFullName], has offered to immediately surrender his position and domain in exchange for granting him asylum."
 dvg_hawaii.4.f:0 "The bizarre country of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_FGH').GetName]- which seemed more like a pirate haven than it did a legitimate government could effortlessly subjugated by the  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] navy. In a brief exchange in the Honolulu harbor, Marshal [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_FGH').GetRuler.GetFullName] has met with some of our representatives. While others with ambitions in the Pacific have been quick to protest our abrupt action against [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_FGH').GetName] we can at least procure some good will with our soldiers. Improving relations with the  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_ig').GetName]  may prove incalculable."
 dvg_hawaii.4.a:0 "No, enemies of the state aren't welcome no matter who they are."
 dvg_hawaii.4.b:0 "He is welcome back, but he will receive a trial."
 dvg_hawaii.4.c:0 "He is welcome back, and we give him full amnesty."

 dvg_hawaii.5.t:0 "The End of the Oligarchy"
 dvg_hawaii.5.d:0 "Following the Marshall's Death, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was brought back under the control of its indigenous people."
 dvg_hawaii.5.f:0 "Yeng Futing had always insisted on a firm hand when dealing with the native peoples of  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] declaring that they would seize any moment of weakness to rise up even as he demeaned them as primitive savages. It seems that he was right to be paranoid. Just before dawn this morning a strike force of three Scandinavian men-of-war pulled into Hilo harbor cannons blazing. In the confusion of the assault Scandinavian marines travelled north by boat away from the heat of the fighting then made landfall and snuck into the city. Just as Marshall Chen was informed of the invasion the marines ・ led by Prince '[SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_iolani').GetFullName]  ・ fought their way into the palace and took Chen by surprise as he was escaping. Chen died in a shootout in the palace gardens and soon [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective]avian reinforcements arrived to secure the capital. News of the invasion spread across the islands igniting a deluge of native uprisings which have shattered the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetAdjective] dominion. 'Iolani has been enthroned as King of a united Hawaii backed by [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] firepower"
