 dvg_indochina.1.t:0 "Retake Rakhine?"
 dvg_indochina.1.d:0 "Decades ago, the Spanish arrived on our shores and coerced us with their new advanced weaponry, forcing us to cede the Rakhine Coast too them."
 dvg_indochina.1.f:0 "However, our new king has undergone a series of reforms, now with an expanded army and increased weapon-making capabilities."

 dvg_indochina.2.t:0 "Collapse of Central Authority"
 dvg_indochina.2.d:0 "For much of its history, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was able to assert its territorial control due to its centralized military being able to subjugate the various ethnic groups that made up the nation."
 dvg_indochina.2.f:0 "However, the recent loss and subjugation has enabled once-dormant sepratist groups to take up arms for their own independence. Already, these ethnic groups were reluctant to serve under the authority of a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] government. Now, seeing the prospect of being subjugated and exploited by yet another power and its subsequent power vacuum, it was the perfect opportunity to take up arms. \n\n All these years spent building up the military to fight against colonialism-what was it all for? If it was to maintain independence as a sovereign nation, it was all surely in vain. However, just because the ambitions of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] King have been put down, does not mean the others' have been."

 dvg_indochina.3.t:0 "Recognition"
 dvg_indochina.3.d:0 "Decades ago, the Spanish arrived on our shores and coerced us with their new advanced weaponry, forcing us to cede the coast of Rakhine too them."
 dvg_indochina.3.f:0 "However, under our new king, we have been able to take back what was rightfully ours. The European powers will have to reckon with us now on a more balanced footing. The Europeans have agreed to recognized our claims as well."
 dvg_indochina.3.a:0 "Now, let's find ourselves a place on the world stage."

 dvg_reclaim_khmer: "Reestablish the Old Borders"
 dvg_reclaim_khmer_desc: "The Empire has regained the upper hand in the peninsula but it is far from its old standing. It is time to bring the Thai and the Champas under our leadership to regain pre-eminence in the region!"
