  je_mahdist_revolt: "Mahdist Unrest"
  je_mahdist_revolt_reason: "In 1821, our victory against the Funj Sultanate brought the lands of the Blue Nile under our control. Despite this, our authority in the region remains fragile, as its majority Muslim population is reluctant to accept Christian rule. Now, reports reach the capital of a militant group led by a fanatic who has proclaimed himself the 'Mahdi', leading revolts against our garrisons in an attempt to restore Sudanese independence."
  je_mahdist_revolt_goal: "The Mahdists have revolted against us"
  je_religion_ethiopia: "The Ethiopian Orthodox Church"
  je_religion_ethiopia_reason: "Since the conversion of Negus Fasilides I to Catholicism in the 17th century, Abyssinia has been a staunch ally to the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire], collaborating to contain Rumian expansion in the Red Sea. Despite this, Spain has proven to be an unreliable partner, occupying territories along the Eritrean coast and allowing the [concept_dvg_jesuit] to gain ample autonomy within our realm. Though Fasilides II is a devout follower of his ancestor's ways, his heir is known to harbor connections to underground Orthodox organizations, who seek to restore the empire's traditional religion and expel European influences."
