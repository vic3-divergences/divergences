 #Vryland primer
 dvg_vryland.1.t: "Land of the Free"
 dvg_vryland.1.d: "In the power vacuum of the Burgundian-Geuzen Wars, a new republic was established to the north of the Cape."
 dvg_vryland.1.f: "What was once a trickle of escaped slaves and discriminated Bastaards, soon became a flood of refugees finding a safe haven in sparsely populated land. Although the wars have been put on hold for now, our state is now bordered by slavers and colonisers. Surely, as the "civilized" Africans, it is our duty to save our bretheren from this oppression."
 dvg_vryland.1.a: "Our freedom may not come without blood."

#Decisions
