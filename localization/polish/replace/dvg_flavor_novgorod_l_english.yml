  je_nov_main:0 "Lord Novgorod the Great"
  je_nov_main_reason:0 "For years many years now [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has suffered, having slipped into a state of decline ever since the [concept_dvg_neva_war]. We must pull ourselves into the modern world just as [concept_dvg_alexander_nevsky] has done in the past, lest we fall to the wayside of history just as many others have foolishly done so."
  je_nov_main_goal:0 "Complete 3 'Reform' [Concept('concept_journal_entry', '$concept_journal_entries$')]"
  je_nov_serfdom:0 "Reform: Serfdom"
  je_nov_serfdom_reason:0 "Novgorod is a collection of different political entities that have different legislations, especially regarding serfdom. There has been no major evolution in serfdom legislation for at least fifty years, but the percentage of serfs has been steadily increasing."
  je_nov_serfdom_goal:0 "The following must be true for 10 total years:"
  je_nov_non_russians:0 "Reform: Non-Russians"
  je_nov_non_russians_reason:0 "While Finnic minorities are tolerated, the farther east one goes the more hostility towards Uralic people grows. The economy of the North greatly benefits from the yearly fur tax, the yasak, demanded from Samoyedic and Komi tribes. Political integration would mean losing this lucrative tax."
  je_nov_bureaucracy:0 "Reform: Bureaucratic"
  je_nov_bureaucracy_reason:0 "Our bureaucracy is a patchwork of archaic laws and systems. The administration is in choas, and if we are to overcome the many challenges to our rule, we must modernize our system."
  je_nov_education:0 "Reform: Education"
  je_nov_education_goal:0 "Increase the literacy rate of your people by 25%."
  je_nov_education_reason:0 "So few within our domain have access to education. We should establish schools in which to teach them."
  je_nov_urban_center:0 "Reform: Centralize Novgorod"
  je_nov_urban_center_reason:0 "We should centralize our production in our great city."
  je_nov_advance:0 "Advances the Journal Entry 'Lord Novgorod the Great'"
  finished_nov_tt:0 "Has completed or failed the Lord Novgorod the Great [concept_journal_entry]"
  nov_andrei_yuriyevich_died:0 "The Prince of Novgorod has died"
  nov_andrei_yuriyevich_died_fail:0 "The Prince of Novgorod has died and was unable to complete 3 'Reform' [Concept('concept_journal_entry', '$concept_journal_entries$')]"

  dvg_nov.1.t:0 "Lord Novgorod the Great"
  dvg_nov.1.d:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is on at crossroads. If we do not reassert [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] sovereignty and reclaim our place among the Powers of the world, we risk catastrophe."
  dvg_nov.1.f:0 "Novgorod is a confederation of various states, princedoms, and republics swearing fealty to 'Lord Novgorod the Great'; the city of Veliky Novgorod and its institutions. These institutions are made of three entities: the prince, the Council of Lords and the Great Veche, which is a public assembly led by the Posadnik, the mayor of Novgorod. The Republic has suffered a terrible blow with the loss of the Republic of Pskov, reorganized as a Scandinavian satellite state following the [concept_dvg_neva_war] that ended in 1712. In 1836 the Republic is at a crossroads: It must centralize and reform its institutions, which would anger the princedoms and republics within its borders who rely on ancient privileges. Will Novgorod wear the mantle of [concept_dvg_alexander_nevsky] and lead Russia towards a new era, perish under the Scandinavian boot, or suffocate by its byzantine politics?"
  dvg_nov.1.a:0 "For Novgorod the Great!"
  dvg_nov.2.t:0 "The death of our prince"
  dvg_nov.2.d:0 "The city was profoundly moved by the death of the Prince of Novgorod."
  dvg_nov.2.f:0 "The Prince was a controversial yet beloved figure whose personality sternly guided the Confederation through the dangerous waters of political unrest. With ever more frequent and patient collaboration, the moderates of both sides in the Veche and the Council of Lords have found a common ground for the interests of Novgorod."
  dvg_nov.2.a:0 "We will continue to reform our republic"
  dvg_nov.2.b:0 "We will become a Monarchy"
  dvg_nov.3.t:0 "Death of the prince"
  dvg_nov.3.d:0 "After a long and disastrous reign, the Prince of Novgorod has finally died."
  dvg_nov.3.f:0 "Despite his erratic behaviour, he was widely recognised as the last figure capable of keeping together the confederation. The Council of Lords and the Veche have convened to elect a new Prince but are unable to find a similarly compromising figure. Meanwhile, the confederation is in such a chaotic state that representatives from the Siberian and Uralic territories have not reached [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] yet. The Prince of Galich, has been the main obstacle to the election process, having recalled multiple times the representatives of his princedom from both the Council of Lords and the Veche."
  dvg_nov.3.a:0 "These are troublesome times"
  dvg_nov.4.t:0 "Death of the confederation"
  dvg_nov.4.d:0 "The confederation has been dissolved."
  dvg_nov.4.f:0 "Meanwhile the authority of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has crumbled in the North and East, as the Pomors and Uralics refuse to accept the new state of affairs."
  dvg_nov.4.a:0 "These are troublesome times"

  nov_resolved_nonrussians:0 "Resolved the Uralic petition"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.1.t:0 "The Uralic petition"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.1.d:0 "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is a constituent member of the Novgorod confederation, but many of its inhabitants are not Slavs but Uralic people who are discriminated against by various Russian laws."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.1.f:0 "Vyatka is a peculiar case of political integration, as Uralic people live within its borders and enjoy a certain degree of citizenship rights. However, They are still treated as second-class citizens, despite their almost complete conversion to Orthodoxy. The Uralic people of the republic have petitioned the local Veche to abolish some long standing norms like discriminatory legislation for land ownership and military conscription. The spokesman of this group is Yevgeny Blinov, a russified Udmurt noble and patron of the first Udmurt publishing house, his wealth has attracted many Vyatkan officials to his side."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.1.a:0 "Vyatka will recognize the rights of its loyal citizens"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.1.b:0 "This is a Slavic Republic!"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.3.t:0 "The conscription law"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.3.d:0 "The news of the integration of Uralic peoples in the Vyatkan Republic has created a negative reaction in Novgorod. While Finnic minorities are tolerated, the farther east one goes the more hostility towards Uralic people grows."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.3.f:0 "The economy of the North greatly benefits from the yearly fur tax, the yasak, demanded from Samoyedic and Komi tribes. Political integration would mean losing this lucrative tax and challenge the colonial attitude some colonists harbor towards the Uralic people. The northern volosts have asked the Veche how to deal with this large minority who have heard of the new Vyatkan laws. A new conscription law is proposed as a replacement for the yasak, which would establish Komi and Nenets units as military reserves and assistants for frontier outposts and isolated garrisons. Tyko Verigin, a representative of Samoyedic origin from the volost of Arkhangelsk, also proposes to give Uralic chieftains and elders the right to join local administrative assemblies, giving them a voice in the administration of their land."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.3.a:0 "Savages do not deserve rights"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.3.b:0 "The Conscription law strikes a compromise"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.3.c:0 "Rights are granted to the Uralics"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.4.t:0 "News from Novgorod"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.4.d:0 "Our new laws of integration for the Uralic peoples have created quite a stir in Novgorod, for the Veche has reaffirmed the discriminatory laws that we abolished."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.4.f:0 "While autonomous, we still bow to Lord Novgorod the Great and keeping our laws could be poorly seen in the capital. On the other hand, it would be easy enough to write a sham law that would appease the republic while keeping the rights."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.4.a:0 "We bow to our Lord of course"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.4.b:0 "Our rewriting means nothing, we assure you!"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.5.t:0 "Uralic unrest"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.5.d:0 "Our refusal to grant rights to the Uralic people have created unrest within our small republic."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.5.f:0 " The Uralics living in Vyatka have started to resent the increasing discrimination caused by the harsh rejection of Blinov's proposals and strange rumors come from their territories, talking of seditions and troubles to come."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.5.a:0 "They can revolt. We are stronger!"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.6.t:0 "Blinov's insurrection"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.6.d:0 "The Uralics have declared independence under the guidance of Blinov!"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.6.f:0 "A Confederation with a political structure based on the democratic institutions of Vyatka. Envoys from Vyatka are rejected and Russian garrisons are being harrased. Many Russians in the countryside are escaping north or west, although those living in urban centers have been granted full rights. Vyatka must rally the various garrisons and march East to avoid a complete collapse of their authority in the hinterlands. Envoys have also been sent to Novgorod to ensure we get reinforcements."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.6.a:0 "Pesky Udmurts!"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.7.t:0 "News from Vyatka"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.7.d:0 "Worrying news has reached us from our subjects in Vyatka."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.7.f:0 "The small republic is facing an insurrection launched by the Udmurt tribes, who have grown resentful of the discrimination they face in their lands. They ask us for our support in quelling the rebellion."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.7.a:0 "We will march against the Udmurts!"

  dvg_nov_non_russians.10.t:0 "Defeat in the Votyak War"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.10.d:0 "As the Udmurts have secured their territory and defeated the platoons sent to defeat them, the Novgorodian Republic has been forced to recognize their independence to avoid any more financial losses."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.10.f:0 "The defeat in the Votyak War proves the disastrous condition of the Novgorodian army and the administrative chaos of the confederation, which couldn't resist the uprising of mere disgruntled peasants. Valuable territory has been lost and communication with the Ural territories has become more difficult, as Novgorodians envoys and merchants must circumvent Udmurt territory to avoid customs or harassment."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.10.a:0 "What has happened to us."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.11.t:0 "Victory in the Votyak war!"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.11.d:0 "The Udmurts have been vanquished and their territory has been reintegrated into the republic."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.11.f:0 "The end of the Votyak War proved that Novgorod still has an army capable of ensuring control of the confederation's territory, although many still doubt the capability of its leaders in the case of an actual conflict. The exile of Yevgeny Blinov and the closure of his publishing house has radicalised the few Uralic intellectuals, which along with rogue chieftains continued to stir unrest in the region long after the end of the uprising."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.11.a:0 "The Republic is restored!"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.11.b:0 "We have won!"

  dvg_nov_non_russians.12.t:0 "Fate of Vyatka"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.12.d:0 "Novgorod must decide what to do with Vyatka."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.12.f:0 "The Vyatkan Veche has been replaced by a military authority, people flee westward and the economy is in shambles. Routes towards Siberia move northwards outside the territory of the Republic, the Vyatka river is too dangerous to navigate. Two options are proposed: Vyatka would be reorganised under a military government becoming a stronghold against the attacks coming from the Tatars and the Uralic tribes or the Vyatkan Veche would be restored as before."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.12.a:0 "The military takes control"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.12.b:0 "The Veche is restored!"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.13.t:0 "Administering Vyatka"
  dvg_nov_non_russians.13.d:0 "Vyatka could not resist the decline brought by the Udmurt war, and has petitioned for further integration with the Republic because of the accumulated debt and the financial losses of the war."
  dvg_nov_non_russians.13.a:0 "We welcome them!"
