 dvg_standalone_flavour.1.f: "\"I was standing on the bank of a river some hours from Stung Treng, far north of Phnom Penh. There I saw the stag, he stood and stared at me, his antler's the shape of a lyre and brown fur shimmering, far whiter than any stag I had seen on my many adventures to the Highlands. I began to sketch him immediately, however he turned away only a moment later, I named it after my father who I loved dearly; Walter Barclays.\""
 dvg_standalone_flavour.1.a: "What a magnificent creature!"

 dvg_standalone_flavour.2.f: "A well-known gambler and even more well-known food enthusiast, the Earl of Mayo has been atribbuted to the creation of a new foodstuff named the Mayo by his friends, quickly spreading the dish across the aristocracy of our country, popularising it amongst the upper classes! Now with our growing food industry, the dish has spread amongst the middle and lower classes, with mayo street vendors turning up in every city! Whilst similar dishes have existed in the past across many parts of the world, this version has been quickly popularised by being accidentally created at the right place, at the right time!"

 #Spread of Mulberry trees across Fusang
 dvg_standalone_flavour.3.t: "Mulberry Trees & Mountains beyond the Valley"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.3.d: "Sericulture amongst Qingqiuans has persisteded for centuries on the small-scale, but now with the growth of the industry, the White Mulberry Trees used for it have spread far and wide, beyond the limits of the orchard fences"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.3.f: "With the continued expansion of the silk inudstry in the Valley, the presence of Mulberry trees have only become greater, spreading far and wide across the valley, many elderly valley-dwellers remember a time where they weren't as widespread and different plants grew in greater numbers, only to be choked out by the hardy trees. Now there have been sightings of Mulberry trees growing beyond the Xueshan, hugging the few permanent rivers of Dayan and now spreading as far east as Menzhou. Many people say that someday the trees will cross the Mingxing Shan, yearning for the rivers of the Great Plains, perhaps becoming a common sight across all of [concept_dvg_arcadia]..."
 dvg_standalone_flavour.3.a: "Their perseverance is admirable, yet concerning."
 
 #Qingqiun Kanhu
 dvg_standalone_flavour.4.t: "Singing in the Kanhu Room"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.4.d: "Kanhu is a widely popular game amongst all Qingqiuans, now the first Kanhu Palace has been constructed in [SCOPE.sState('scope_qingqiuan_kanhu_state').GetName], serving as a hub for not only Kanhu players, but many different performers, gamblers and public speakers!"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.4.f: "Qingqiuan Kanhu is an adaptation of Kanhu, having evolved gradually, instead of using coins and string, mock-coins were used in the early 1500s before being banned by Japanese bureaucrats. This forced Kanhu players to use depections of natural scenery on slips of paper, with streams, mountains and dwellings instead, with some regional variation. Now most households have a Kanhu set, with wealthier people having sets printed on wood rather than paper, in 1829 a particularly famous set was made out of worked gold, which was eventually sold to a wealthy gold-mining family. The new Kanhu Palace has quickly become a bustling cultural hub, in particular singers have began to perform on the lower levels of the building, with one of the most famous songs being \"Kanhu Room\", telling the story of a nervous child intimidated by their mother as they play Kanhu together, having forgotten how to play, the child instead daydreams of singing and playing with his friends in the room."
 dvg_standalone_flavour.4.a: "'Come sing it again my friend!'"
 
 #Scandinavian National Animal
 dvg_scandinavian_national_animal: "A National Animal for Scandinavia?"
 dvg_scandinavian_national_animal_desc: "In the more cosmopolitan circles of Scandinavia, the idea of a national animal has been discussed, initially being a novel idea, perhaps now is the right time to make one official?"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.5.t: "A National Animal for Scandinavia"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.5.d: "Initially beginning as an idea in cosmopolitan circles of Scandinavia, the idea of a national animal has made its way to our government. A novel idea, surely to please most, we will select one to represent all Scandinavians!"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.5.f: "After a lengthy process and several, overly-heated dinner debates, we have been presented with a list of animals and reasoning behind each one as to why it should be a candidate for the national animal of Scandinavia. Perhaps there is a little pressure on us to make something that will please all, however in due time surely all will come to see whichever animal we select as a unifying figure of all of Scandinavia and all Scandinavians!"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.5.a: "The Mute Swan; its elegance and beauty represents our people and country. It's quiet yet poised nature represents Scandinavians' attitudes to be thoughtful yet fierce when need be, a true representation of the Scandinavian people."
 dvg_standalone_flavour.5.b: "The Scandinavian Lynx; quiet, enduring and skilled, it represents the Scandinavian work ethic and the hardiness of our people, it is favoured by some nobles due to it being present on heraldry, additionally, some sketches show that its kittens are quite adorable!"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.5.c: "The Brown Bear; intelligent, powerful and protective, a perfect representation of Scandinavia on the world stage, these honourable creatures are widespread across almost all Scandinavian-speaking lands and represent not just Scandinavian citizens, but all Scandinavians."
 dvg_standalone_flavour.5.e: "The Eurasian Perch; plentiful and ever-persistent, an odd choice, being the only fish on the list given to us, yet a representation of the Scandinavian middle class and peasants, the Perch is a true representation of all Scandinavians, not just the wealthy."
 dvg_standalone_flavour.5.h: "A novel concept indeed, yet too novel, we have no need for this."

 #crab rangoon debate
 dvg_standalone_flavour.6.t: "Origin of the Fried Crab Horn"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.6.d: "Qingqiu's food is much like its people: a myriad diversity of a thousand traditions melting together from all across East Asia and the Northern New World. Nothing exemplifies this more than one of the latest innovations in the long history of Fusangese gastronomy, now becoming the table favorite of Taixi miners, urbanites, and and voyageurs. The Crabe Yangonne, as it's now known throughout Arcadia, has become the ubiquitous dish of cuisine chinoise, perhaps entirely catering to the Far West's palate, and overall is now an expected staple in every restaurant throughout Qingqiu. This recipe, first named \"fried crab horn\" by the Qingqiuans, wraps crab meat within a wonton, stuffed with cream cheese, onion, and garlic, then fried until golden brown. The dungeoness crab has ever been a staple of Qingqiuan cuisine, since the earliest days of Fusang, so perhaps it was only a matter of time before such a fusion of culinary idea came about... And only a matter of time before arguments over claims of invention arise."
 dvg_standalone_flavour.6.f: "One tale originates from Sanbao, out of a kitchen in the harbour district of the downtown. Working for a prominent Kaiganese restauranteur, the Taishanese chef Mun Tang proudly recounted to his local newspaper how he had been inspired during a trip to Fang Hu, and on one particular night after returning home, struggled to feed a rowdy, inebriated group of Taixi longshoremen. Clamoring to please the restaurant's guests last minute, he threw leftovers from the kitchen together in order to satiate their appetites, devising the concept for the dish. However, none can seem to even recall such a dish being added to the restaurant's menu until after the recent popularity of fried crab horns. At the same time, to the North in Xiaosu province, there exists an extreme sense of seafood superiority amongst the locals of the sound. The city of Baishan is widely seen as the capital of crustacean cooking in Fusang, with the Zhang family claiming to have outright invented it a century ago. Descending from an original Wu migrant family, a half-Buyeoan branch from the city's outskirts claims their great grandmother had adapted a fried tofu wonton to include crab meat instead, with a dubious scrappings of a recipe book as evidence. This too fails in the face of scrutiny, as many families claim the very same, and all these recipes hardly include most of the requisite ingredients. An outright rivalry has developed amongst these two culinary centers in Fusang, one that is sure to stand for the rest of time. Regardless of its origin, fried crab horns are destined to be the most quintessentially authentic Qingqiuan dish enjoyed the world over, even as its label as Chinese food would baffle any purist mainlander, and perhaps even the food libertines of Guangdong."
 dvg_standalone_flavour.6.a: "Fried crab horn was clearly invented in Sanbao!"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.6.b: "Baishan is the home of the fried crab horn!"
