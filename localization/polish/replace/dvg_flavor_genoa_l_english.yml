 genoa.1.t:0 "A Precarious Rule!"
 genoa.1.d:0 "The coup of Lodovico della Rovere saw the end of the Genoese republic that had existed for centuries thanks to his grip on the army. As of late, however, his autocratic rule has alienated him from several officers. Throughout Liguria, many resent him, from the lowest classes to the old patricians who dream of restoring the Superba. Among them is Gastone Buonaparte, former left hand of Lodovico della Rovere who has grown estranged over the years from the Duke. Rumor has it that some officers feel that the moment to restore the Republic has come. But the Duke still has some support and is well prepared to face his opponents."
 genoa.1.f:0 "In due time the shores of Italy were sighted, and as we stood gazing from the decks, early in the bright summer morning, the stately city of Genoa rose up out of the sea and flung back the sunlight from her hundred palaces. - Mark Twain""
 genoa.1.a:0 "We stand at the precipe"
 genoa.2.t:0 "Meeting with the Bank of Saint George"
 genoa.2.d:0 "With the current political and economic decline of Genoa, Duke Dellar Rovere has increasingly been forced to turn to the Bank of Saint George to finance his luxurious tastes and the Genoese public finances. Yet with the public debt ballooning and Genoa increasingly unable to pay its debts, the Bank of Saint George has demanded a meeting with the Duke to get the public finances back in order. However, Duke Dellar Rovere did not rise to his position to now give up his luxurious lifestyle and has instead decided on an alternative solution to sort out the public finances. Though the bankers had been shocked by his proposal of the sale of Corsica and South Cameroon, after a quick recovery and calculating the likely sale price, both sides agreed upon this unconventional solution."
 genoa.2.f:0 "Though in the back of Duke Dellar Rovere’s head, he knew that this sale would mark the end of Genoese empire and force his enemies to act."
 genoa.2.a:0 "We will announce the sale at the holiday of San Gian Batista"
 genoa.3.t:0 "The Leak"
 genoa.3.d:0 "Though both the Duke and the Bank of Saint George attempted to keep the sale of Corsica and South Cameron under wraps, it was perhaps inevitable given the unpopularity of the Duke that it would leak to Gastone Buonaparte and his Patrician supporters. Though the Patricians have mixed feelings about the sale of Genoa’s remaining colonial holdings, the sheer loss of prestige and power this sale would represent has forced the patricians to move their plans forward. Knowing that the announcement will occur on San Gian Batista holiday, it is hoped that the chaos of the announcement will allow for a successful coup."
 genoa.3.f:0 "In there rush to meet the fated deadline, no one thought of the external consequences of there actions"
 genoa.3.a:0 "The die is cast"
 genoa.4.t:0 "The San Gian Batista Coup"
 genoa.4.d:0 "Saint John the Baptist is the patron saint of Genoa and his holy day is a day of feasting for the city. It was on that fateful day that Duke Lodovico della Rovere chose to make his announcement of the sale of Genoa’s colonies and the Patricians under Gastone Buonaparte decided to act. The Duke is preparing his speech before the Piazza Matteotti, while loyal soldiers of Gastone Buonaparte prepare to storm the Palace of the Doges and restore the Republic. If the Duke is caught unaware then he is doomed, but he is a crafty man who might snatch victory from the jaws of defeat."
 genoa.4.f:0 "At Genoa, the word Liberty may be read over the front of the prisons and on the chains of the galley-slaves. This application of the device is good and just. It is indeed only malefactors of all estates who prevent the citizen from being free. In the country in which all such men were in the galleys, the most perfect liberty would be enjoyed. — Jean-Jacques Rousseau"
 genoa.4.a:0 "The Duke Reigns Supreme"
 genoa.4.b:0 "The Patricians Seize Control"
 genoa.5.t:0 "Restoration of the Superba"
 genoa.5.d:0 "Gastone Buonaparte has triumphed! Della Rovere’s forces were quickly overpowered before most of them had even left their quarters. Unfortunately, the Duke himself was able to flee before he could be arrested – it seems that he had put a hidden passage into the palace for exactly this scenario, and was spirited out by a few loyal servants. But that is a concern for another day. For now let us celebrate the end of his tyranny!"
 genoa.5.f:0 "Warning, the Duke may be gone, but Savoy will likely take this opportunity to attempt to conquer our country, we should prepare."
 genoa.5.a:0 "Molto bene"
 genoa.6.t:0 "Restoration of the Superba"
 genoa.6.d:0 "The former duke of Genoa, Lodovico I Della Rovere, has settled in Turin with his spouse Maria of Savoy, sister of our Duke Vittorio Filiberto. He shows few signs of wanting to fight for his former title. As our own royal court sees it, this is a wonderful opportunity: Savoy has wanted to expand into Liguria for centuries, and Lodovico could be persuaded to renounce to his claims in favor of our own Duke who could then rightfully restore order to these seditious Republicans. The price would not be cheap, as Della Rovere is known for his extravagant -and costly - lifestyle, and could severely hamper the finances of the state in the coming years. Additionally, the Dual Monarchy is unlikely to approve of conflict in Italy so soon after the end of the Italian revolution."

 genoa.6.b:0 "It isn't worth the cost..."
 genoa.7.t:0 "Chaos in Genoa"
 genoa.7.d:0 "News has quickly reached Barcelona of a succesful Genoese coup against Duke Lodovico della Rovere. While Genoa is but a shadow of it's former self, the Duke's inability to fund his lifestyle provided Aragon an opening by which to acquire favorable trading conditions and priviliges in return for absolving some of the Dukes debts. However, with the Duke no longer in power, our merchants have lost there favorable trading status and are forced to trade just like any other power."
 genoa.7.f:0 ""
 genoa.7.a:0 "If Genoa does not want to accept our terms, then it's merchants will not be welcomed in our markets"
 genoa.8.t:0 "Diplomatic Disaster in Savoy"
 genoa.8.d:0 "With the recent coup in Genoa, the King of Savoy has decided to seize the opportunity and invade Genoa. Sadly, prior to the invasion, our ambassador in Savoy attempted to defuse the situation so as to prevent the toppling of the fragile status quo within Italy. Acting on his own volition, the ambassador threatened grave consequences if Savoy were to invade Genoa. However, now that Savoyan troops are crossing the border, we must take action lest our country become a laughing stock throughout Europe."
 genoa.8.f:0 "An ambassador is not simply an agent; he is also a spectacle. - Walter Bagehot "
 genoa.8.a:0 "Though it is unfortunate, no nation should disrespect our ambassadors, especially those who will soon find themselves kicked out of our markets."
 genoa.8.b:0 "Recall the ambassador for insorbination and apologies to the King of Savoy for his threats"
 genoa.9.t:0 "Italian Revolutionaries Offer Support"
 genoa.9.d:0 "With the restoration of the Genoese Republic and subsequent invasion by Savoy, the radical Bolognese school have started to increasingly come out of the shadows. While this faction represents a threat to the stability of our Republic due to there calls of a unified Republican Italy, the threat of annexation by Savoy has meant that they are willing to temporarily allign with our goverment against Savoy. Recently, a group of ex-revolutionary officers have proposed that we make up for our numerical inferiority through the implementation of national militias. While this would greatly expand our military, our military advisors are worried about our ability to arm this new army that will be lead by potentially disloyal elements."

 genoa.10.t:0 "Genoa Rallies Around the Flag"
 genoa.10.d:0 "Despite facing a superior enemy, Genoa has managed to survive and hold off the foreign invader, with the public increasingly rallying around the flag and uniting around the common cause of survival and freedom, through acts of extreme military bravery and financial support for the states."
 genoa.10.f:0 ""
 genoa.10.a:0 "We count our blessings and hope that Genoa may yet survive"
 genoa.10.b:0 "All of this was not possible without the support of the Bolognese school, perhaps they should be a part of our goverment."
 genoa.11.t:0 "The Bolognese School Demands Wealth Voting"
 genoa.11.d:0 "With our nations survival against Savoy, the radical republicans and nationalists in our goverment have now demanded that we honor the efforts of the public that fought for us by implementing wealth voting. Most of the Patricians are appauled by these demands and worry that this will undermine there power. However, the Bolognese school has much of the support of the wider public, and if this demand is not met, then it is likely that the public will quickly turn against us."

 genoa.12.t:0 "Rumblings from Corsega"
 genoa.12.d:0 "Corsica has always been a periphery of the Republic of Genoa. Acquired in the Middle Ages from Pisa, it was for centuries a Genoese colony, the locals having no representation in the Republic and being forced to pay heavy taxes. To worsen this situation, Corsica is a poor mountainous island, whose society is held by clannish ties and honor, with frequent vendettas. The island is thus largely left to her own, with Genoa content with only exploiting the coast and its cities for money. However, the need for troops in our war with Savoy has left the island garrison increasingly under strength, which has lead to the various clans on the island to unite and demand better treatment and equal rights. If we do not accept these demands, then it is highly likely that the island will revolt. However, as a Corsican, Doge Bonaparte believes that he can quell the unrest once and for all by integrating the clan heads into our rule. Though the military may grumble that it is better to nip this rebellion before it grow into a larger far more dangerous force. "

 genoa.13.d:0 "Corsica has always been a periphery of the Republic of Genoa. Acquired in the Middle Ages from Pisa, it was for centuries a Genoese colony, with the locals having no representation in the Republic and being forced to pay heavy taxes. To worsen this situation, Corsica is a poor mountainous island, whose society is held by clannish ties and honor, with frequent vendettas. The island is thus largely left to her own devices, with Genoa content with only exploiting the coast and its cities for money. However, with the heavy cost of the Genoa-Savoy War, the garrison on Corsica has increasingly been weakened while war taxes have been implemented throughout the island. This weakness and injustice has been seized upon by the notable revolutionary mercenary Mateo Falcone. Having studied in Bologna and fought as a mercenary throughout Europe before assuming his position as head of his family in Corte, the general has attacked the ports and unified the island under his rule. Now fully in control of the island, the general has convened a Diet in the center of the island to discuss the future. To path forward is clear, either Corsica ferociously guards her independence alone or it must join the Revolutionaries of Etruria for protection and equal rights."
 genoa.13.f:0 "It is important to note, that if Corsica asks Etruria for support, Corsica will be annexed if Genoa losses or decides to not invade"

 genoa.14.d:0 "The Corsicans have recently rebelled against their Genoese oppressors. However, alone they are quite vulnerable, and so they have turned to us for support. While Corsica would prefer to be independent, they would be willing to join our nation instead, due to our representative goverment and reputationt compared to that of the Genoese. Doing so, however, would be tantamount to an act of war against Genoa."
