 dvg_cuba.1.t: "Cuba, the Pearl of the West Indies"
 dvg_cuba.1.d: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was Spain’s most prosperous colony in the West Indies due to its lucrative cash crop exports which soared during the height of the slave trade. With the abrupt end of the slave trade and the reformist current in the mainland which led to the Peninuslar War however, had put pressure on her colonies leading to the Colombian War of Independence."
 dvg_cuba.1.f: "Due to Cuba’s strategic location as a supply base for Spanish forces in Ameriga and its lack of autonomy compared to its other holdings in the New World, any local resistance on the island was dealt with swiftly. The only threat came in 1832, during the failed Cuban uprising led by the reckless [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_castro').GetFullName] during the final years of the Colombian War until the Armistice of 1834. We have dealt with [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_castro').GetLastName]’s goons, and the vast canefields teemed with slaves whose souls are bound to the land. The mighty isle of the Caribbean stands still - for now."
 dvg_cuba.1.a: "Let us hope that the situation remains that way."
 dvg_cuba.2.t: "The Cuban Situation - A Promise Kept?"
 dvg_cuba.2.d: "The establishment of another constitutional democratic country in Europe to defy the old monarchist order was a move most welcomed by most like minded liberals and freethinkers alike, but not by our esteemed subjects in our “colonies”. The newly sworn provisional Chartrist government's recent efforts to emancipate and to grant reparations to freed slaves were welcomed, but were botched in practice: Most of the funds ended up in the pockets of corrupt officials and stubborn landowners utilizing loopholes to subject freed laborers into day long shifts and adverse working conditions to maximize profit."
 dvg_cuba.2.f: "Even freed and educated Caribenos and criollos in the mainland have voiced their plight to the press, gaining traction among the public, even at times demanding a beleaguered Congress to act on the situation - to no avail. Some of our policymakers are even wondering, are we still even “democratic” at all with the matters at hand?"
 dvg_cuba.2.a: "A promise unfulfilled."
 dvg_cuba.3.t: "The Castroist Scourge returns!"
 dvg_cuba.3.d: "When it came to our attention that Colombian president Anastasio Vicente had been assassinated it was hard for many in our government to not crack a smile at hearing that the man who caused us so much trouble was finally dead. However, upon hearing about who replaced him, worry once again returned. The infamous ‘Scourge of Salvador de Cuba’, the former daunting and reckless right hand man of Vicente, Lieutenant Colonel Ernesto Castro has seized the reins of power in Gran Colombia after rallying the military and the centralists to his side."
 dvg_cuba.3.f: "He has promised that Colombia will be “the true seat of power in the New World.” as well as “unafraid to make adventurous choices in the interest of liberation.” Many are taking this to mean that Colombia will try to take Cuba and this is evidenced by long dormant rebel cells in Cuba being spurred back into action once again, probably funded by the miscreants in Mexico City. This situation is unacceptable, and the loss of Cuba would prove unbefitting of our status and tarnish our reputation as a great power on the global stage!"
 dvg_cuba.3.a: "Oh no!"
 dvg_cuba.4.t: "Rumors of Castro's Return to Cuba"
 dvg_cuba.4.d: "Distressing news from Salvador de Cuba! The infamous ‘Scourge of Salvador de Cuba’, the former daunting and reckless right hand man of Anastasio Vicente, Ernesto Castro, was rumored to be in Cuba in his self exile after his failed attempt at a power grab following the death of his superior, Anastasio Vicente. Staying true to his reputation, he brought along with him all his entourage, remaining plunder, munitions and weapons in a makeshift, stealthy sloop, setting sail to a remote location in Cuba where he was welcomed by a holdout of revolutionaries."
 dvg_cuba.4.f: "Our efforts to track him have all ended in failure, and his mere presence and legacy here has empowered many oppressed Caribenos and locals alike to join his ranks, engaging in skirmishes and raids with the local Spanish garrison. His ranks grow by the minute, exploiting the various tensions in the island, and our dire situation in the mainland is fanning the flames to his cause."
 dvg_cuba.4.a: "Telegraph the Governor General! This is some serious business here!"
 dvg_cuba.5.t: "The Growth of the Tabacaleras in Cuba"
 dvg_cuba.5.d: "Our governor in Cuba has decided to invest in tobacco, if not a bit too much."
 dvg_cuba.5.f: "Our sugar plantations there are being dwarfed by production of this increasingly popular plant, potentially upsetting the balance we've already had. Should we intervene in this endeavor?"
 dvg_cuba.5.a: "Determining what is grown is well within his rights. Tobacco it is!"
 dvg_cuba.5.b: "Strongly discourage him from replacing the sugar plantations. We still need the sugar."
 dvg_cuba.5.c: "Tell him we need to think beyond just tobacco and to grow coffee in the east."
 dvg_cuba.6.t: "La Castración"
 dvg_cuba.6.d: "The blight of rebellion has returned to Cuba, seemingly wanting to finish off Spain’s grasp in the New World while seizing the opportunity that was given by the chaos that ravaged the mainland in recent years. ‘I would love to share every single detail available to us…’ – said an official in a report from Cuba about the insurgency – ‘..but information is difficult to obtain in these times.’"
 dvg_cuba.6.f: "The rebels have ruined any safe method of communication, captured every messenger that crossed into their range, and they might have embarked on a campaign of misinformation in order to make us fall for their traps and ambushes. It might be safe to say that we are quickly losing our grip on Cuba, and if an order from the metropolis is not given IMMEDIATELY, anyone who would follow said order shall be found murdered by those savages once they stop hiding in the wilderness’. If we are not able to bring tranquility back to the island anytime soon, Cuba will surely end up going through the same post-independence struggle that has plagued their brothers in the mainland indies.
 dvg_cuba.6.a: "Not even our overseas men can escape from Spain’s misery."
 dvg_cuba.7.t: "The Republican Malaise"
 dvg_cuba.7.d: "These recent times have been very tough for the colonial administration of Cuba, having to decide how to proceed with the current economic turmoil in the agricultural sector while also having to defend the institutions from the violent uprising that is still ravaging the lands of Cuba only to retreat back to the wilderness afterwards, avoiding retaliation."
 dvg_cuba.7.f: "It seemed like the revolutionary movement would keep gaining strength, but recent reports state otherwise, talking about the lessened intensity of the attacks perpetrated by the rebels, even though the authorities have not gone through any change in tactics or leadership in face of the conflict. Intelligence has revealed what seems to be an inner dispute among the leadership of the movement, the local republican leaders and Castro. Some even accuse him of planning to make himself not only a dictator, but a Monarch with absolute power over the island. This divide has severely hindered the capabilities of the rebels, giving Spain some time to breathe and possibly plan a counterattack against them."
 dvg_cuba.7.a: "Nothing else can be expected from revolutionaries."
 dvg_cuba.8.t: "The Death of Ernesto Castro"
 dvg_cuba.8.d: "’I have faced enough betrayals to know that I do not deserve to live among these rats and vipers. Please concede me this last request: Allow me to talk to He who holds the keys of heaven, and let my companions spend the rest of their days in endless anguish in the ninth circle.’ – Ernesto Castro’s last words, according to royalist soldier Gabriel Zuñiga."
 dvg_cuba.8.f: "He was found outside the castle, accompanied only by his sword despite having led an entire army just a few hours ago. One of the soldiers that was roaming around the place was the one who, without any kind of hesitation, shot him before confirming his identity. Reportedly, the whole attack was a part of a plan crafted by the republican leaders of the insurgency to take Castro out of the equation. Have him lead a charge, order a retreat and shoot Castro’s steed dead to leave him stranded in the frontline. The revolution has lost its most brilliant commander, who fell victim to the conflicting interests of his comrades."
 dvg_cuba.8.a: "A traitor betrayed by his own traitors."
 dvg_cuba.9.t: "The Death of President Castro"
 dvg_cuba.9.d: "Reports have come in from Mexico City about the death of Colombian president Ernesto Castro. This was caused by the absence of democracy, along with Castro’s failure to make Colombia a great power and the rumors about his monarchist ambitions have caused a great political malaise in the whole nation. His political opponents also claimed that his desire to free Cuba was only fueled by his preference for his homeland, and that Colombia’s already limited funds were being wasted for other goals other than improving the citizens’ lives."
 dvg_cuba.9.f: "Acknowledging that his time was running out after receiving warning about military action against him led by Agustin de Santander, he prepared for his own exile and a future life in the city of Rome, before he was apprehended by Santander’s soldiers who surprised him in his own ship. Ernesto Castro was executed by a firing squad the next Tuesday, third hour of the morning."
 dvg_cuba.9.a: "A traitor betrayed by his own traitors."
 dvg_cuba.10.t: "The Cuban Governor's Monoculture"
 dvg_cuba.10.d: "With the death of Castro, in spite of the reasons for the revolt, it seems our current governor in Cuba has gone to expand existing and build new cash crop plantations without our input."
 dvg_cuba.10.f: "This policy is creating monocultures on a massive scale. This has upset the Cuban population as the replaced fields are apparently symbolic of not being able to choose their own destinies, much less grow their own crops."
 dvg_cuba.10.a: "This is a policy that certainly benefits us at least."
 dvg_cuba.11.t: "The Remedios Speech"
 dvg_cuba.11.d: "After the death of Ernesto Castro we thought that revolutionaries in Cuba would wither away. However, our agents discovered a meeting of various known revolutionaries in San Juan de los Remedios and were able to eavesdrop on a speech delivered by one [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_quesada').GetFullName]. In this speech Quesada called for the revolutionaries to prepare for the liberation of Cuba by amassing arms wherever possible and to spread the message to the Caribenos throughout the island. Unfortunately our agents were too few in number to arrest everyone there, but now we know who we are dealing with."
 dvg_cuba.11.f: "From our records Quesada is a plantation owner and seemed complacent with the Cuban administration, however that seems to have been a front. It is now believed that he is the leading republican revolutionary and had been working with Castro to overthrow our rule. We have sent agents to try and find Quesada before his revolt can occur, but he and his workers were nowhere to be found at his plantation and it seems he has gone into hiding."
 dvg_cuba.11.a: "These revolutionaries are like a hydra."
 dvg_cuba.12.t: "The Grito de Varguitas" 
 dvg_cuba.12.d: "’They heard bells without knowing from where’ – Old Spanish saying \nIt was not very smart to think that the Cubans would forget all their grievances once Castro died.’ –  an observer near the Fortress of Varguitas wrote – ‘The Cubans do not fight exactly for republicanism, illustration or other intellectual motives. They fight only for independence, to sever the Crown’s hand that lies in the island’." 
 dvg_cuba.12.f: "The revolution has regained its strength after the rapid rise of Quesada among the ranks of the rebel leadership. Their new efforts have been successful in recruiting a massive amount of followers with a great commitment to the independentist cause. Although their numbers may seem intimidating, their forces are still largely unprofessional, often barely armed due to Spain’s restrictions on gun ownership and their arsenals gaining better defenses as time passed. The damage will be immense, but in the end, the cries of war of Cuba may fall silent once again."
 dvg_cuba.12.a: "If they think they can defeat us, they have another thing coming."
 dvg_cuba.13.t: "End of The Cuban Guerra Grande"
 dvg_cuba.13.d: "After about 40 years of conflict that many call the Guerra Grande it appears that resistance to our rule has finally ended. Despite there being some holdouts, the level of violence has finally been reduced to a level the local police can handle."
 dvg_cuba.13.f: "The revolutionaries themselves lie broken and their great leader Quesada died at some point during the conflict, but it seemed even without him his followers continued to try and fulfill his dream of a free Cuba. With order restored now we can focus on developing the island as we see fit."
 dvg_cuba.13.a: "Forty years and at last we have peace!"
 dvg_cuba.14.t: "The Cuban Revolutionary Communist Organization"
 dvg_cuba.14.d: "With the end of the Cuban Guerra Grande we thought we had broken the idea of a free Cuba among the population of the island. However, the idea of secession from our empire has now mixed with the ideas of Communism among the planter working class. As a result, a new group has come to prominence called the Organização Comunista Revolucionária Cubana - Cuban Revolutionary Communist Organization - or OCRC for short."
 dvg_cuba.14.f: "The OCRC for the most part is an underground organization and despite our best efforts we have not been able to weed them out, and unfortunately it looks like they are only growing stronger. If this continues the OCRC may become strong enough to launch a rebellion much greater than the Guerra Grande and in a worst case scenario it may result in an independent Cuban state. No matter what, we must be prepared for whatever happens."
 dvg_cuba.14.a: "Great another revolutionary cell, whatever."
 dvg_cuba.15.t: "The Cuban Revolutionary Communist Organization"
 dvg_cuba.15.d: "After we destroyed Cuba during their failed war of independence we thought we had broken the idea of a free Cuba among the population of the island. However, the idea of secession from our empire has now mixed with the ideas of Communism among the planter working class. As a result, a new group has come to prominence called the Organização Comunista Revolucionária Cubana - Cuban Revolutionary Communist Organization - or OCRC for short."
 dvg_cuba.15.f: "The OCRC for the most part is an underground organization and despite our best efforts we have not been able to weed them out, and unfortunately it looks like they are only growing stronger. If this continues the OCRC may become strong enough to launch a rebellion much similar to the last independence war. No matter what, we must be prepared for whatever happens."
 dvg_cuba.15.a: "We aren't afraid of them."
 dvg_cuba.16.t: "Colombian Navy Spotted Off Cuba"
 dvg_cuba.16.d: "We have received reports of small ships of the Colombian Navy being spotted off the coast of Cuba. We have also received reports of them sending people and some kind of cargo ashore as well. We fear that Colombia is supplying rebel groups in Cuba and not only that, but also training them in preparation for a larger uprising."
 dvg_cuba.16.f: "We have tried to intercept these ships, but their small size makes them very maneuverable and so far they have evaded our patrols. Colombia denies any part of this, but with the rhetoric coming from their president [SCOPE.sCountry('colombia_scope').GetRuler.GetFullName] it seems clear that they are behind this. At this point the governor of Cuba is requesting us for more men to station on the island. Already rebel activity is increasing in Cuba and it seems like the current situation is becoming untenable."
 dvg_cuba.16.a: "Why can’t they just leave us alone?"
 dvg_cuba.17.t: "Plantagenian Navy Spotted Off Cuba"
 dvg_cuba.17.d: "We have received reports of small ships of the Plantagenian Navy being spotted off the coast of Cuba. We have also received reports of them sending people and some kind of cargo ashore as well. We fear that Plantagenia is supplying rebel groups in Cuba and not only that, but also training them in preparation for a larger uprising. We have tried to intercept these ships, but their small size makes them very maneuverable and so far they have evaded our patrols."
 dvg_cuba.17.f: "Plantagenia officially denies any formal part in this, instead claiming that this is the result of some private citizens. They claim that they will try to arrest anyone taking part, but according to them an attack on one of their citizens would be as good as a declaration of war to them. At this point the governor of Cuba is requesting us for more men to station on the island. Already rebel activity is increasing in Cuba and it seems like the current situation is becoming untenable."
 dvg_cuba.17.a: "What did we ever do to them?"
 dvg_cuba.18.t: "Arcadian Navy Spotted Off Cuba"
 dvg_cuba.18.d: "We have received reports of small ships of the Arcadian Navy being spotted off the coast of Cuba. We have also received reports of them sending people and some kind of cargo ashore as well. We fear that Arcadia is supplying rebel groups in Cuba and not only that, but also training them in preparation for a larger uprising. We have tried to intercept these ships, but their small size makes them very maneuverable and so far they have evaded our patrols."
 dvg_cuba.18.f: "Arcadia has fully admitted that they are behind this and will continue until the Cubans have achieved their independence. For now we have done nothing against the Arcadians and are focusing on trying to stop the ships. At this point the governor of Cuba is requesting us for more men to station on the island. Already rebel activity is increasing in Cuba and it seems like the current situation is becoming untenable."
 dvg_cuba.18.a: "We’ll see about that."
 dvg_cuba.19.t: "The Colombian Republic of Cuba"
 dvg_cuba.19.d: "Our control over Cuba has effectively disintegrated! Rebel cells all over the island have risen up and have easily seized control of everything outside of Santiago de Cuba. The rebels leader, Ignacio García de Quesada, has announced the creation of the Colombian Republic of Cuba reaching out to Colombia to formally join their nation. We are mobilizing our army in response as fast as we can in response and we hope to be able to launch a response force in the next few days."
 dvg_cuba.19.f: "There is no doubt that Colombia will intervene in this conflict, but since this would require them to be able to ferry troops into Cuba, if we are able to enforce a naval blockade around the island we should stand a chance against them so long as their navy is as pathetic as we remember it was. #red If they are able to hold the entire island for about two and a half years then we will be forced to recognize their government and bring hostilities to an end.#!"
 dvg_cuba.19.a: "Colombia! We should have destroyed you when we had the chance."
 dvg_cuba.20.t: "Cuba Asks For Our Help"
 dvg_cuba.20.d: "Our agents have successfully seized control over all of Cuba outside of the Spanish stronghold of Santiago de Cuba, and have declared a new republic. The Spanish government has declared the Cuban government as illegitimate and is making plans to retake control of the island."
 dvg_cuba.20.f: "The new Cuban Republic has made it clear that it wishes to join us and has asked for our help in the upcoming war with Spain. Since we have come this far it would be political suicide to back down now, we must come to their aid and rid the new world of the Spanish forever. #red If we are able to secure all of Cuba for about two and a half years then Spain will be forced to recognize Cuba and end the upcoming war in our favor.#!"
 dvg_cuba.20.a: "Time to vanquish Spain once and for all."
 dvg_cuba.21.t: "The Cuban War of Independence"
 dvg_cuba.21.d: "Once again Spain is at war with Colombia, this time over the island of Cuba. Colombia, under the guidance of Colombian president [SCOPE.sCountry('colombia_scope').GetRuler.GetFullName], has sent agents to facilitate an uprising on the island of Cuba and now that uprising has seized control of everything outside of Santiago de Cuba. The men behind the uprising have announced their intent to create the Colombian Republic of Cuba."
 dvg_cuba.21.f: "Spain refuses to recognize this new republic and has announced that the uprising will be put down by military force. Colombia followed suit and announced that they will support Cuba in the war against Spain with the expectation that Cuba will join Colombia after the end of the war. This will be Spain’s last chance to hold onto the New World and save what remains of their Empire."
 dvg_cuba.21.a: "We’ll teach [SCOPE.sCountry('colombia_scope').GetRuler.GetLastName] a lesson"
 dvg_cuba.22.t: "We Have Failed Cuba"
 dvg_cuba.22.d: "Despite our promises and our efforts, we have failed to protect the Cuban Republic from the Spanish. Once again the Spanish are in control of the island, and the revolutionaries that once tried to help us have either fled the island or have died."
 dvg_cuba.22.f: "This entire affair has become an embarrassment to Castro and appears to have completely destroyed his political standing. There are already murmurs of a plot against Castro brewing and the future for Colombia appears to becoming bleaker by the day."
 dvg_cuba.22.a: "The vultures begin to circle."
 dvg_cuba.23.t: "We Have Reclaimed Cuba!"
 dvg_cuba.23.d: "Even though Cuba lies an ocean away, we were successful in suppressing the rebellion that took control over the island. While Colombia may have defeated us before, we have shown that they still lack the capability of waging a successful naval campaign."
 dvg_cuba.23.f: "We have arrested all members of the rebellion we could fine and have already executed their leaders including Ignacio García de Quesada. With the destruction of this rebellion we should now be able to solidify our rule and govern Cuba however we see fit."
 dvg_cuba.23.a: "Nice try Colombia."
 dvg_cuba.24.t: "We Have Lost Cuba"
 dvg_cuba.24.d: "Disaster! Despite our efforts we have been forced to recognize the loss of Cuba. Colombia has once again, and hopefully for the final time, beat us and seized our last holding in the New World."
 dvg_cuba.24.f: "This is a major loss for us and has left our reputation in tatters. Colombia appears ready to annex Cuba, and we can only hope that they share the same problems we have had."
 dvg_cuba.24.a: "The New World is forever lost to us now."
 dvg_cuba.25.t: "Cuba Formally Joins Us."
 dvg_cuba.25.d: "We are victorious in freeing our Cuban brothers and banishing the Spanish from the New World. While the leader of Cuba, Ignacio García de Quesada, had hoped that Cuba could become a free republic, our agents have made sure that the representatives in the Cuban government are firmly under our control."
 dvg_cuba.25.f: "With that Cuba has now formally asked to be incorporated into our country and after a short debate for formality on our side the request was accepted. With the admission of Cuba into our country Ernesto Castro’s popularity has reached unprecedented heights. This appears to have helped mend the rifts in our country and many are starting to see Castro as the savior Colombia needs."
 dvg_cuba.25.a: "Our Reconquista is finally complete."
 dvg_cuba.26.t: "The Republic of Cuba"
 dvg_cuba.26.d: "Our control over Cuba has effectively disintegrated! Rebel cells all over the island have risen up and have easily seized control of everything outside of Santiago de Cuba. The rebels leader, Ignacio García de Quesada, has announced the creation of the Republic of Cuba severing any ties the island once had to our country. We are mobilizing our army in response as fast as we can in response and we hope to be able to launch a response force in the next few days."
 dvg_cuba.26.f: "There is no doubt the people who helped back their rebellion will intervene in this conflict, but since this would require them to be able to ferry troops into Cuba, if we are able to enforce a naval blockade around the island we should stand a chance against them so long as we can enforce naval dominance then we should stand a chance. #red If they are able to hold the entire island for about two and a half years then we will be forced to recognize their government and bring hostilities to an end.#!"
 dvg_cuba.26.a: "We need to move quickly"
 dvg_cuba.27.t: "Cuba Declares Independence"
 dvg_cuba.27.d: "Our agents have successfully helped the Cuban rebels gain control over all of Cuba outside of the Spanish stronghold of Santiago de Cuba, and have declared a new republic. The Spanish government has declared the Cuban government as illegitimate and is making plans to retake control of the island."
 dvg_cuba.27.f: "The new Cuban Republic has asked for our help in the upcoming war with Spain. Since we have come this far it would be political suicide to back down now, we must come to their aid and rid the Carribean of the Spanish forever. #red If we are able to secure all of Cuba for about two and a half years then Spain will be forced to recognize Cuba and end the upcoming war in our favor.#!"
 dvg_cuba.27.a: "Together we shall defeat Spain"
 dvg_cuba.28.t: "The Cuban War of Independence"
 dvg_cuba.28.d: "Conflict has broken out over the island of Cuba. Cuban rebels with support of a local power have risen up and have overthrown Spanish control of the island outside of the stronghold of Santiago de Cuba and have announced the creation of the Republic of Cuba. Spain refuses to recognize this new republic and has announced that the uprising will be put down by military force."
 dvg_cuba.28.f: "The new Cuban government has been able to secure an alliance with the country supporting them and plans to fight to the end for their freedom. Some people have doubts regarding the Cuban’s benefactor, with some of them thinking that they plan on seizing control of the island for themselves, but if something like this were to happen, they would have to defeat Spain and force them to recognize the loss of the Island."
 dvg_cuba.28.a: "We will take back what is ours!"
 dvg_cuba.29.t: "We Have Reclaimed Cuba!"
 dvg_cuba.29.d: "Even though Cuba lies an ocean away, we were successful in suppressing the rebellion that took control over the island. The rebellion's supporters thought that we would be an easy target, but we have shown them that they should never mess with a European power."
 dvg_cuba.29.f: "We have arrested all members of the rebellion we could fine and have already executed their leaders including Ignacio García de Quesada. With the destruction of this rebellion we should now be able to solidify our rule and govern Cuba however we see fit."
 dvg_cuba.29.a: "Everything is as it should be."
 dvg_cuba.30.t: "We Have Failed Cuba"
 dvg_cuba.30.d: "Despite our promises and our efforts, we have failed to protect the Cuban Republic from the Spanish. Once again the Spanish are in control of the island, and the revolutionaries that once tried to help us have either fled the island or have died."
 dvg_cuba.30.f: "This entire affair has become an embarrassment to our government. Though many still wish for us to try again, unfortunately without the revolutionaires and freedom fighters that Cuba once had, we would be hard pressed to create a decent casus belli that isn’t just naked imperialism."
 dvg_cuba.30.a: "It was worth a shot"
 dvg_cuba.31.t: "We Have Lost Cuba"
 dvg_cuba.31.d: "Disaster! Despite our efforts we have been forced to recognize the loss of Cuba."
 dvg_cuba.31.f: "The logistical issues of carrying out a campaign across the pacific were too much to overcome and we had no choice but to admit defeat. This is a major loss for us and has left our reputation in tatters. We can only hope that this new republic shares the same problems we have had."
 dvg_cuba.31.a: "Curses!"
 dvg_cuba.32.t: "Cuba is Liberated!" 
 dvg_cuba.32.d: "We are victorious in aiding the Cuban freedom fighters and have secured their independence from the Spanish." 
 dvg_cuba.32.f: "The success of this operation has humiliated Spain and has boosted our fame worldwide. We have fulfilled our obligations and will now leave the Cubans to govern themselves as they see fit."
 dvg_cuba.32.a: "Now the people of Cuba are in charge of their destiny."
 dvg_cuba.33.t: "Cuba is Free, and Ripe for Conquest" 
 dvg_cuba.33.d: "We are victorious in aiding the Cuban freedom fighters and have secured their independence from the Spanish. The success of this operation has humiliated Spain and has boosted our fame worldwide." 
 dvg_cuba.33.f: "While we have fulfilled our obligations the Cubans have never governed a country before and it might be beneficial for them if they were to become a part of our country. This would strengthen our power in the Caribbean and give us access to the lucrative cash crops present in Cuba. Of course this betrayal wouldn't look very good, but then again why should the spoils go to the victors?"
 dvg_cuba.33.a: "Time for some new management."
 dvg_cuba.33.b: "We said we fight for freedom and we shall give it to them."
 dvg_cuba.34.t: "Communists Seize Control of Cuba"
 dvg_cuba.34.d: "What started as a general strike among the planters in Cuba, has now spread out as a full blown rebellion. The OCRC have seized control of government institutions on the island outside of Santiago de Cuba and have declared the creation of the People’s Republic of Cuba."
 dvg_cuba.34.f: "As we speak they are going around seizing plantation estates and arresting anyone tied with our government. Plans are being drawn up and we will begin a formal operation to retake the island in a few days. We don’t know if anyone is helping them, but we must be prepared for any surprises. #red If they are able to hold the entire island for about two and a half years then we will be forced to recognize their government and bring hostilities to an end.#!"
 dvg_cuba.34.a: "Prepare the army we need to retake Cuba"
 dvg_cuba.35.t: "Communists Seize Control of Cuba"
 dvg_cuba.35.d: "What started as a general strike among the planters in Cuba, has now spread out into a second rebellion against our rule. The OCRC have seized control of government institutions on the island outside of Santiago de Cuba and have declared the creation of the People’s Republic of Cuba."
 dvg_cuba.35.f: "As we speak they are going around seizing plantation estates and arresting anyone tied with our government. Plans are once again being drawn up and we will begin a formal operation similar to the one we conducted some odd years ago to retake the island. We don’t know if anyone is helping them, but we must be prepared for any surprises. #red If they are able to hold the entire island for about two and a half years then we will be forced to recognize their government and bring hostilities to an end.#!"
 dvg_cuba.35.a: "Aw, crap, here we go again"
 dvg_cuba.36.t: "The Cuban Revolution"
 dvg_cuba.36.d: "The Cubans have risen up with rifles and shovels under the name of proletarian enfranchisement. After many years of strife during the Cuban Guerra Grande many thought that the islands were entering a new period of peace."
 dvg_cuba.36.f: "However, the issues that caused that conflict were never addressed and have once again flared up. While major speeches are happening throughout the island as the populace braces for war, and Spanish elites are preparing for the inevitable conflict as well. Spain’s jewel in the Caribbean is aflame and this war will finally decide if the Cubans can achieve their dreams of freedom."
 dvg_cuba.36.a: "Death to the Communists and to the revolution!"
 dvg_cuba.37.t: "The Second Cuban War of Independence"
 dvg_cuba.37.d: "It’s happened again! The Cubans have risen up with rifles and shovels under the name of proletarian enfranchisement. After the Spanish were successful in subduing the first Cuban War of Independence many thought that would be the end for the Cuban drive for self-determination."
 dvg_cuba.37.f: "However, the issues that caused that conflict were never addressed and have once again flared up. While major speeches are happening throughout the island as the populace braces for war, and Spanish elites are preparing for the inevitable conflict as well. Once again Spain’s jewel in the Caribbean is aflame and this war will finally decide if the Cubans can achieve their dreams of freedom."
 dvg_cuba.37.a: "Death to the Communists and to the revolution!"
 dvg_cuba.38.t: "We have reclaimed Cuba, again!"
