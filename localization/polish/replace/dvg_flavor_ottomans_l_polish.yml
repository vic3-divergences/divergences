  je_sick_man_macedonia:0 "Tanzimat: Reclaim Macedonia and Bulgaria"
  je_sick_man_macedonia_reason:0 "For centuries, Bulgaria enjoyed a (mostly) uniterrupted period of Ottoman rule. Now, after the ruinous civil war, the ungrateful Bulgarians have been subjugated by another disloyal former province - the Macedonians. Both must be returned to the grace of the Empire, hastily."
  je_sick_man_albania:0 "Tanzimat: Reclaim Albania"
  je_sick_man_albania_reason:0 "The Albanian vilayets have always pushed for autonomy and reforms - so it is no wonder that the traitors took the the first chance they saw for independence. The Albanian dream of independence must be short-lived, for the destiny of the Empire demands it."
  je_sick_man_iraq:0 "Tanzimat: Reclaim Mosul and Baghdad"
  je_sick_man_iraq_reason:0 "In the midst of the chaos created by the Ottoman Civil War, the Pashaliks of Mosul and Baghdad, united under the leadership of Faysal Jalili, declared independence from the Sublime Porte. With no forces to spare for an expedition to the Levant, the House of Osman reluctantly recognised Jalili as Malik of Iraq. We should bring Mosul and Iraq back under Turkish dominion."

  je_tur_reclaim_macedonia_reason:0 "For centuries, Bulgaria enjoyed a (mostly) uniterrupted period of Ottoman rule.

  je_tur_reclaim_albania_reason:0 "The Albanian vilayets have always pushed for autonomy and reforms - so it is no wonder that the traitors took the the first chance they saw for independence. The Albanian dream of independence must be short-lived, for the destiny of the Empire demands it."
  je_tur_reclaim_iraq:0 "Retake Iraq"
  je_tur_reclaim_iraq_reason:0 "While not entirely opposed to Ottoman rule, the Iraqi Elayets saw an opportunity during the civil war to declare independence, and they took it. To restore the honor of the Empire, Iraq must be returned."
  je_tur_reclaim_serbia:0 "Pacify the Serbs"
  je_tur_reclaim_serbia_reason:0 "One of the more uppity of our territories, several large uprisings have taken place in Serbia during our several hundred years of rightful occupation. However, being a strong seat of Jannisaries, at the edge of the Empire, the Serbs used the civil war to break away from our rule. They must be pacified!"

  dvg_sick_man.1.f:0 "The road to decline began with the rise of Selim III in 1789. Selim, ever the reformer, sought to reform an Ottoman Empire that had begun to lag behind the European powers, a decline began at the beginning of the century. However, one such reform, to create a European-styled Army, was opposed violently by the Janissaries, who had Selim murdered in 1807 and replaced with his cousin, Mustafa IV. This move saw revolts by the reformer elements within the Empire, triggering the Ottoman Civil War, a period of almost thirty years of conflict between the reactionaries under Mustafa IV, and the forces of reform under his brother, Suleiman. Eventually, the reformers won, but the balkans was lost. Now we can finally start the reforms that are required to rise again. First, of course, we need to replace the Janissaries with a truly modern military force. But in addition, we must restore the place of the Sublime Porte as the very height of civilization. Education, urbanization, and sovereignty shall be the top items of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] agenda."

  dvg_mcd_acceptgreeks_desc:0 "We have formed a nation for the Southern Slavs, but many prominent members of our government are still Greek. Perhaps they can be reintegrated into a new nation for both Southern Slavs and Greeks?"
