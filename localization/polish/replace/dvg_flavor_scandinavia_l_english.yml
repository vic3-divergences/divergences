 dvg_scandinavia.1.t: "The Kingdom of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_scandinavia.1.d: "The United Kingdom of Scandinavia and Scotland, heir to the Kalmar Union, extends from Scotland to Novgorod, from the Arctic Circle to northern Germany."
 dvg_scandinavia.1.f: "Following the conclusion of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], although making great territorial gains, finds itself in a delicate position. Unrest and separatist nationalism are on the rise from the Highlands of Scotland to the marshes of Finland, fueled by economic decline since the 18th century. King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] the III, who ascended the throne after the end of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], has called the Scandinavian Parliament into session for the first time in years after the absolutist policies of his father. Yet his methods remain authoritarian, [concept_dvg_fish]. A great storm is brewing in Scandinavia, and whether the United Kingdom will manage to weather it remains to be seen"
 dvg_scandinavia.1.a: "Til Skandinaven!"
