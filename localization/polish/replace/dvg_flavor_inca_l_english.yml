 je_seizing_collasuyu_reason: "The southern reaches of the continent lie unclaimed by any European powers thanks to the fierce Mapuche resistance, which has also foiled our own prior attempts at seizing these lands.

 #Route-Specific Tooltips
 concept_dvg_amachaq: "Amachaq"
 concept_dvg_amachaq_desc: "Meaning 'defender' or 'law-maker', the Amachaq are a new political class which has emerged in the empire, a consequence of [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] Washkar granting his inner circle, composed almost entirely of foreigners or people normally excluded from [concept_dvg_inka] seats of power, the benefits of being [concept_dvg_inka_by_privilege], creating a new military elite with interests vastly different from the nobility."

 seizing_collasuyu.1.a: "Qullasuyu is ours!"

 #Inca Reconquest Events
 dvg_inca_reconquest.1.t: "The Realm of the Four Corners"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.1.d: "For nearly four hundred years, the children of [concept_dvg_inti] have ruled the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Our great empire once encompassed much of the Andes mountains, the sacred home of our ancestors since the dawn of creation. However, conflict with the barbarous [SCOPE.sCountry('spain_scope').GetAdjective] invaders saw our northern territories estranged, and the shadow of war has loomed over our realm ever since."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.1.f: "Over the centuries, the empire has suffered much, and changed much in turn. With war between our people and the barbarians becoming a constant reality, our traditional way of life is put in jeopardy, as more and more concessions are made in order to survive. Even then, we carry on our duty as the bringers of civilization, heirs to [concept_dvg_pachacuti] and [concept_dvg_ninan_cuyochi], rendering order upon a chaotic world.\n \nFour years ago, the vile [SCOPE.sCulture('granadan_scope').GetName] barbarians and the traitorous [concept_dvg_chimu] lords sacked our holy city of [concept_dvg_cuzco] in the [concept_dvg_fifth_andine_war], yet it was our mighty [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] who saw their forces beaten back. Since then, we have experienced a period of relative stability and recovery, as support from our [SCOPE.sCountry('burgundy_scope').GetAdjective] and [SCOPE.sCountry('japan_scope').GetAdjective] allies allowed us to repair the damage dealt to the capital. This has emboldened the Sapa Inka, who now departs on a grand expedition to pacify the [concept_dvg_mapuche] tribes and secure our vulnerable southern border."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.1.a: "Onwards!"

 dvg_inca_reconquest.2.t: "Mercantilism With Inka Characteristics"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.2.d: "When the [SCOPE.sCountry('spain_scope').GetAdjective] invaders first assaulted our lands, they brought with them weapons and technology we did not yet know. But though we struggled against gunfire and viral outbreaks, our great empire did not give in. It was commerce with the [SCOPE.sCountry('burgundy_scope').GetAdjective] merchants, interested in the vast amounts of silver from the mines of Potosi, which gave us the means to fight back."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.2.f: "Although the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] had originally been a moneyless society, modernity has forced us to adapt. Ever since the times of [concept_dvg_francois_bart], the empire has increasingly adopted mercantilist policies, hiring European specialists and envoys to manage its trade, though foreigners were still subject to extensive restrictions. During his reign, modernizer [concept_dvg_poma_waman_amaru] put great effort into developing the empire's diplomatic presence, culminating in the leasing of two ports along the Pacific Coast to European companies.\n \nLater still, during the 18th Century, the [concept_dvg_incan_japanese_treaty] was signed with [SCOPE.sCountry('japan_scope').GetName], bringing great volumes of Asian goods to the Andes, along with significant Japanese cultural influence. However, the lack of a formal currency greatly disadvantaged our economy, as we had no other means but to pay these merchants in exorbitant amounts of raw gold.\n \nIt was at the start of his reign that [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] proclaimed the era of Musuqyachiy Kichariy Ima, or 'Reform and Opening-Up', and the silver bullion Qullqi-Inti became the official coin of the empire. Though the reforms greatly strengthened our economy, building a budget surplus which fueled the Sapa Inka's military endeavors, they have been controversial among several sectors of Inkan society, especially the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('scope_ayllu').GetName], who saw their traditional communal lands subject to expropriation by [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('inka_scope').GetName] lords."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.2.a: "To get rich is glorious!"

 dvg_inca_reconquest.3.t: "The Great Army of the Inka"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.3.d: "Ever since the conquests of [concept_dvg_pachacuti], our empire's grand army has been its greatest asset in maintaining control over its myriad territories. Yet, in recent times, the question has arisen on the necessity of military reforms."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.3.f: "The leading proponent in matters of military reform is [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]'s eldest son, the fierce [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_washkar_inka').GetFullName], who has become infamous among the nobility for his reckless nature, jingoistic speeches, embrace of modern military theories, and promotion of foreign figures such as [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_fujimori').GetFullName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_kosciuzko').GetFullName] into the heights of [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('scope_inka').GetName] society with little care for tradition. Some even claim that he seeks to remove aristocratic privilege from the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('scope_armed_forces').GetName] entirely, instead creating a meritocratic system of ranks.\n \nWashkar, for his part, argues that innovation, whether it be the construction of the [concept_dvg_qhapaq_nan] which unites the empire or the adoption of foreign firearms and cavalry, has always been the core strength of the Imperial Army. For it was tactical thinking, the prince claims, that made possible the historic victory of [concept_dvg_ninan_cuyochi] against [concept_dvg_francisco_pizarro], as well as the Inkan triumphs against the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire] during the [concept_dvg_battle_of_quito] and the [concept_dvg_first_andine_war]."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.3.a: "A grand army for a grand empire!"

 dvg_inca_reconquest.4.t: "The Imperial Amautas"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.4.d: "Meaning 'teacher' in [concept_dvg_quechua], the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('scope_amauta').GetName] are the academic class of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], who have received their education in the [concept_dvg_yachaywasi]. Due to their exclusive access to European and Asian philosophies, many amautas have become proponents of imperial modernization through adoption of foreign methods."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.4.f: "Chief among the amautas is [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]'s younger son, the erudite [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_llapa_inka').GetFullName], known for his patient and meticulous manner. In the frequent gatherings of amautas hosted at the royal palace, Llapa is known to have argued at length for the creation of a written script for the Quechua language, the expansion of railroad networks across the empire, and greater integration into the international diplomatic system. Yet while his critics declare that these reforms would lead to the loss of the empire's traditional identity and even its collapse, the prince instead argues that reform is essential to allow the rule of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('scope_inka').GetName] to survive and even thrive in the modern age."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.4.a: "There is much work yet to be done."

 dvg_inca_reconquest.5.t: "The Succession of Khillaspu Inka"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.5.d: "Sustaining grave injuries in the recent war against the [concept_dvg_mapuche], it seems the end of [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]'s reign is imminent. Now, the question has arisen on who the successor should be."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.5.f: "Currently, it is disputed between the jingoistic [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_washkar_inka').GetFirstName], in opposition to his brother, the diplomatic [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_llapa_yupanki_inka').GetFirstName].\n \n[SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_washkar_inka').GetFirstName] is a military expert and the eldest son of the Sapa Inka, respected by the nobility for his role as a war hero in the [concept_dvg_fifth_andine_war], though he is also belligerent and prone to extreme actions. In contrast, [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_llapa_yupanki_inka').GetFirstName], while technically not first in line according to Inkan customs, was viewed more favorably by his father and is a keen diplomat and administrator, though his non-confrontational style is unappealing to many nobles who dismiss him as a coward. Both men have now laid claim to the throne. Whomever is not soon acclaimed as the new Sapa Inka will surely turn to his supporters to escalate the power struggle into something even more serious. Which prince shall take the reins of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]?"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.5.a: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_llapa_yupanki_inka').GetFirstName] is the rightful heir!"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.5.b: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_washkar_inka').GetFirstName] is the rightful heir!"
  
 dvg_inca_reconquest.6.t: "The Plight of the Ayllus"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.6.d: "Outside the great city of [concept_dvg_cuzco] and the bustling treaty ports, most of the population of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is organized into [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('scope_ayllu').GetName], clan-based collective farming communities organized around the traditional principle of [concept_dvg_ayni], or 'reciprocity'."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.6.f: "Since the rise of our empire, the relationship between Qusqu and the Ayllus had been founded on a sense of mutual respect, with the [concept_dvg_mit'a] labor tax being levied from the peasantry during certain periods of the year in exchange for access to welfare and products from the capital, while also allowing the state to maintain its public infrastructure. In recent years, however, the introduction of a monetary economy and land enclosures has greatly damaged these relations, with Ayllus belonging to the southern [concept_dvg_aimara] peoples being purchased or even seized by [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('scope_inka').GetName] nobility, who treat the peasants with the harshness of feudal lords.\n \nFrom this crisis, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_samiri').GetFullName] has emerged as a rising star in Inkan politics. Having begun his career as a bureaucrat in the backwaters of the [concept_dvg_qullasuyu], far outside the zone of interest of imperial examiners and talent scouts, his passionate temperament and fierce defense of Ayni made him a hero among the local people, and the unusual prosperity of the lands under his care caught the eye of a campaigning [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_washkar_inka').GetFullName], who brought the young man to Qusqu to be trained as a governor in the [concept_dvg_yachaywasi]."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.6.a: "Without the Ayni, there would be no Inkan Empire!"

 dvg_inca_reconquest.7.t: "The Constitutionalist Club"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.7.d: "Dissent in the empire is heavily regulated and censored, but the [concept_dvg_cuzco] nobility is known to seldom express unusual ideas quite freely. In recent years, the government has kept track of a young prince from the Hurin Qusqu lineage, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_sayri_rimaq').GetFullName], known to host meetings comprising distinguished [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('scope_amauta').GetName] and foreign specialists, in which seditious topics are discussed."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.7.f: "Groomed to be an imperial administrator like all nobles from the capital, Sayri had free access to the knowledge stored in the [concept_dvg_yachaywasi], and was also tutored by a Burgundian preceptor who acquainted him with the European classics. Sayri first gained renown with the publishing of a manuscript (written in the Burgundian language) outlining a proposed imperial constitution, but later retracted his work following pressure from his family, who see their son as a rebellious youth, fated to grow out of these ideas over time."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.7.a: "Quite a peculiar character."

 dvg_inca_reconquest.8.t: "The Northern Lords"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.8.d: "Prior to the [SCOPE.sCountry('spain_scope').GetAdjective] invasion, our empire consisted of three major ethnic groups: the central [concept_dvg_quechua], southern [concept_dvg_aimara], and northern [concept_dvg_chimu]. Yet the usurpation of our northern [concept_dvg_suyu] has seen the majority of the Chimu turned to Catholicism, led like sheep by their barbarian masters."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.8.f: "From the illegitimate Quitenese state, erected upon the foundations of our noble [concept_dvg_chinchaysuyu], the barbarians launch persistent assaults on our mighty empire, and the border remains ill-defined and volatile.\n \nSubject to Spanish tyranny and enslavement are several noble and robust peoples, such as the [SCOPE.sCulture('muisca_scope').GetName] and the [SCOPE.sCulture('afro_latino_scope').GetName]. Yet it is not the Spaniards, but rather the Chimu, heirs to the disgraced [concept_dvg_paullu_tupac_cuzi], who represent the greatest insult to the values of civilization, having grown estranged from the righteous ways of [concept_dvg_inti] and even their own moon deity, Quillapa Huillac. With the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire] growing weaker by the day, the time of our inevitable reunification draws ever nearer, and these defiled lands will surely be once again purified under the light of Inti."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.8.a: "They have truly fallen from grace."

 dvg_inca_reconquest.9.t: "The 400th Year of the Inkan Empire"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.9.d: "Four hundred years ago, the ever-glorious [concept_dvg_pachacuti] came to rule [concept_dvg_cuzco], and elevated it into the almighty empire of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], crushing all rivals before him, and spreading the light of [concept_dvg_inti] throughout the known world."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.9.f: "By his will, the highlands and lowlands were bound into a single realm, and their peoples united under our magnificent dominion. Despite the coming of the European barbarians, Pachacuti's empire has endured! In the harshest of climates, we remain a mighty empire, without parallel or peer! Against all depredations, we have persevered, as resilient as the great mountains we live alongside.\n \nFrom the highest peaks to the lowest valleys, our domain resounds with fervent praise to Inti and to the majesty and strength of our empire, as we are sure to enter a new golden age under the rule of our new [concept_dvg_sapa_inka], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.9.a: "May we surpass Pachacuti, and our descendants surpass us in turn!"

 dvg_inca_reconquest.10.t: "Divergences"
 dvg_inca_reconquest.10.d: "With the subjugation of the unruly tribes in the south and the reclamation of our rightful lands in the north, we have managed to stabilize our borders and reassert ourselves as the rightful rulers of the four corners."
 dvg_inca_reconquest.10.f: "We now hold ourselves a mighty empire, reforged out of the pathetic Spanish division. Even then, the last centuries have radically altered the demographic and cultural fabric of the continent surrounding us. Not only are our lands in the north now populated by several foreign ethnic groups, many of which spread ideologies and religions anathema to our righteous way of life, but the Euro-Amerigan barbarians in the east still hold our realm in disdain and will surely seek to dismantle us. All in all, the future remains yet uncertain for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], though we may still bask in the glory of this great victory." 
 dvg_inca_reconquest.10.a: "Our empire's might makes us an equal to their great powers."

 #Llapa Events
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.1.t: "The Triumph of Llapa Yupanki Inka"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.1.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_llapa_yupanki_inka').GetFirstName]'s careful preparations guided his faction to victory, enabling them to outfox [SCOPE.sCharacter('leader_washkar_inka').GetFirstName] and his loyalists, disarming them before they could even take to the field."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.1.f: "Much of the aristocracy still saw violent division over the matter of succession, but overall the conflicts between Washkar and Llapa's supporters have been less intense than most had feared. With Llapa coronated [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] in an ornate ceremony, many hope that his modernizing vision will bring [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] prosperity without excessive bloodshed."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.1.a: "Llapa shall lead us into the future!"

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.2.t: "Qusqu, the Navel of the World"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.2.d: "Ever since the northern barbarians defiled the holy city of [concept_dvg_cuzco] in the [concept_dvg_fifth_andine_war], the city has been a mere imitation of its former self. Though the worst of the damage has been repaired, many ramshackle buildings and barebones temples remain. Thus, [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has organized a grand renovation campaign."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.2.f: "Roads are being paved and repaved with European techniques, temples are being refurbished, and the whole city is being given a fresh face — with room for expansion. Special attention is being paid to the [concept_dvg_qurikancha], where imperial artisans are painstakingly restoring its beautiful statues of solid gold, as well as the golden layers of the temple interior, while carefully furnishing the imperial mummies with adornments of the finest quality and purity. With foreign technology mastered and subordinated to our enlightened ways, Qusqu shall soon be a truly imperial city once again, one befitting of being the navel of the world."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.2.a: "A joyous rebirth!"

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.3.t: "The First Train Line in Tawantinsuyu"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.3.d: "Centuries before the coming of the European barbarians, our realm had the finest infrastructure in the Western Hemisphere. The [concept_dvg_qhapaq_nan], our widespread and interconnected network of both tanpu and cobbled roads gave us unparalleled powers of transportation and communication. Now, however, as technology continues to advance, we too must advance with it."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.3.f: "This morning, the first railroad in the empire was finally completed with the assistance of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_scandinavia').GetAdjective] and [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_burgundy').GetAdjective] engineers. The new railroad was designed to connect the important supply centers of Wanqani and Xullaxka together, Xullaxka serving as the lynchpin for all goods entering and leaving the Aimara highlands. The [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] himself hammered in the final, golden nail, in a ceremony well attended by foreign observers. While we currently do not have the capabilities to fully enmesh the nation in the rail network, this still represents a tremendous step forwards in our ability to move people and resources around the empire."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.3.a: "The new face of the Royal Road!"

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.4.t: "Ending the Purumauca Threat"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.4.d: "[concept_dvg_sapa_inka] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] is well known as a pragmatic and sagacious ruler, but that does not mean he is cowardly or weak. No, he is a believer in conservation of strength, to be expended when necessary. He is also a veteran of the southern campaigns, and remembers vividly the pain of watching his father, the former Sapa Inka, perish on the battlefield at the hands of the [concept_dvg_mapuche]."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.4.f: "Imperial units selected for their fierce loyalty and hatred of the Mapuche have been dispatched south to carve a path of destruction through the Mapuche homeland of Purumauca. Anyone who survives will be driven back north, either to a set of fortified settlements at the edge of Mapuche lands, or dispersed to labor centers across the empire via the [concept_dvg_mitma]. These are the last days of Purumauca."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.4.a: "They will defy us no more."
 
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.5.t: "The New Chaskis"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.5.d: "As our experiences with the Mapuche and Quitenese have proven, threats to the empire are numerous and we need agents everywhere. Since the times of [concept_dvg_pachacuti], the [concept_dvg_chaski] have served as our trusted messengers, acting as [concept_dvg_cuzco]'s eyes and ears across the Andes."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.5.f: "Though the expansion of the Iron Qhapaq Ñan has made many of the old Chaski relay points obsolete, [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] believes he can find a new role for these loyal citizens of our realm. The New Chaskis will be a secretive force capable of swiftly dispatching dissidents, even amongst our chosen officials who would dare threaten the empire. Soon, the sound of their pututu and the accompanying sight of their black mantle will bring fear in the hearts of the seditious — for if they don't repent, they will be found."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.5.a: "Hush now, be quiet!"

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.6.t: "The Purification of Chinchaysuyu"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.6.d: "Now that the Realm of the Four Parts once again lives up to its name, we must prevent any possibility of resistance which might allow foreigners to pry our [concept_dvg_chinchaysuyu] away once more."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.6.f: "All Quitenese and Chimu officers will, without exception, be executed. Their knowledge and skills make them too dangerous to be allowed to live, not to mention that they are the most blatant manifestation of the system of conquest which Spain and its inheritors imposed upon Chinchaysuyu. To avoid inspiring their relatives to take revenge, their direct families will also be executed. In addition, our [concept_dvg_chaski] and the native peoples of the area will be given a free hand to settle disputes against the foreigners as they see fit. Combined with a total withholding of all forms of government aid, we should soon be rid of their infection."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.6.a: "This is sacred work."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.7.t: "The First Industrial Plan"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.7.d: "The direction of the imperial court in the economy is an old tradition, even if its actual methods differ from those commonly employed in Europe and Asia. As our technology improves, however, the old systems of [concept_dvg_mit'a] and [concept_dvg_mink'a] are no longer sufficient to fulfill our economic objectives."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.7.f: "Thus, drawing on foreign techniques and ideas of economic development and state-controlled economics, the imperial court has drawn up a new iteration of an industrialization plan. The 'First Ten-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Realm of the Four Parts' or simply the 'First Industrial Plan', calls for the expansion of manufacturing within the empire. It allocates funds for the modernization of farming and mining, as well as grant programs for factory construction. With the supervision of the [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] and his distinguished advisors, this will accelerate [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s economy into modernity."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.7.a: "The plan is law, its fulfillment is duty, and over-fulfillment is honor!"

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.8.t: "Runasimi"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.8.d: "For centuries, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has encompassed a dizzying array of peoples and languages. In this modern era of centralized nation-states, however, it is necessary to bind the empire together in a more decisive manner."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.8.f: "The scholars of the royal court have now proposed that we coordinate the imperial education program and cultural institutions towards the establishment of a new identity. This so-called 'imperial identity', will go beyond that of tribes and peoples, focused instead upon the empire itself. Let our people be divided no longer — now and forever, we shall be one nation, one family of the sons and daughters of [concept_dvg_inti]!"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.8.a: "One people, equal under Inti."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.9.t: "Heir to the Empire"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.9.d: "From his diligent beginnings in the [concept_dvg_yachaywasi] to his glorious rise as [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has always pursued his objectives with clarity of vision and a focused mind. Yet the coming of age of his eldest daughter pushes him into a deep uncertainty."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.9.f: "Though he has worked hard to reform and stabilize the empire ever since his coronation, Llapa fears that all his efforts could be for naught should a succession crisis arise. In his own struggle against his late brother Washkar, it was only through careful planning that the four corners not torn apart in war. From the beginning, the Sapa Inka has known that creating a stable mechanism for succession is key to the empire's longevity, and that the choice of heir must fall exclusively to the emperor, as his father once chose him.\n \nSince her birth, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_princess_kantu').GetFirstName] has stuck close to her father, listening keenly as he spoke of legislation and governance. As a teenager, she showed prodigious ability while studying in the [concept_dvg_akllawasi], though her interests veered far more towards the subjects of history and administration than those of weaving and brewing. Though the nobilty would surely reject the pretense of female rule, Llapa's estranged relationship with his younger sons clouds his mind in doubt."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.9.a: "Will the empire outlive its emperor?"

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.10.t: "Emperor of the Socialists"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.10.d: "One of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]'s many titles is 'Lover and Benefactor of the Poor'. With the growth of socialist movements within the empire, Llapa sought to suppress them while simultaneously absorbing their power base. In the end, the co-opting of the moderate socialists' demands regarding welfare and labor rights has served to alienate the radical republicans, consolidating Llapa's rule."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.10.f: "After lengthy debates within the royal court, a new law package has been drafted to introduce paternalistic welfare to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. The 'Beneficience Act' includes the curtailment of child labor, the strengthening of national health care and hospital funding, and a pension fund for elderly citizens. In a first for our empire, factory workers will be allowed to elect their own managers!\n \nBy framing the act in the language of 'traditional imperial benevolence', it has also included provisions to suppress and persecute those suspected of 'foreign ideology', and the newly-created secret police has already been dispatched to act against these dissidents. This is the herald of a new age of peace and stability in the realm."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.10.a: "A socialist subject of the empire is still a subject."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.11.t: "Proclamation of the Andean Republic"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.11.d: "Over several years of absolute rule, [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] was forced to watch as his royal court slowly turned against him. His flawed reform programme ended up alienating the traditionalists while emboldening the radical republicans, who, under the leadership of [SCOPE.sCharacter('sayri_rimaq_scope').GetFullName], have seized power in [concept_dvg_cuzco] and forced Llapa to abdicate at gunpoint."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.11.f: "As he was dragged away to house arrest in the imperial palace, Llapa wondered where he had gone wrong, and which foreign infiltrators were responsible for this hostile takeover. He blamed the lingering influence of Washkar's loyalists, the Catholics in the north, and even the Beornian raiders. Everyone but himself.\n \nOutside the window of his gilded cage, fireworks illuminated the grand city of Qusqu, now a bastion of republicanism, as agitated crowds raved and danced and argued in the streets. The Andean Republic is to be a new type of state, a synthesis between values of European socialism and traditional principles of [concept_dvg_ayni]. Yet with tensions festering in the palaces and administrative offices, many wonder how long they have until the aristocrats make their next move."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.11.a: "Long live the republic!"

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.12.d: "With his reforms in place and rule consolidated, [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] can finally fulfill his long-held desire to travel the world! While he is gone, his sacred [concept_dvg_wak'a] 'brother', a golden statue representing the other half of his [concept_dvg_camaquen], will act in his place as ruler of the empire."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.12.f: "Though he is interested in touring the great cities and geographic marvels of Europe, the largest portion of his trip is dedicated to a lengthy stay in [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_japan').GetName]. Despite this, he is known to harbor a long-standing desire to visit the Kingdom of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_burgundy').GetName], our realm's most important economic and cultural partner in Europe. Along the way, he will also meet with a variety of government officials in an effort to furnish [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s international image."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.13.t: "The Emperor and the King"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.13.d: "It was in Anvers that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] met the man he'd most looked forward to meeting during his time in Europe, King [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_jean').GetFullName] of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_burgundy').GetName], architect of [concept_dvg_paternalism]. The two have exchanged letters in the past, and Jean is perhaps the only European who Llapa sees as even remotely comparable to himself."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.13.f: "Both Jean and the emperor's retainers were astounded when Llapa — having studied the languages of Burgundy thoroughly in preparation for his visit — not only greeted him in Burgundian but carried on most of their conversation in that barbarian tongue! The two of them discussed rulership, their personal lives, the most beautiful places in Tawantinsuyu and Burgundy, and their distaste for Catholics. The Sapa Inka's knowledge of astronomy particularly impressed the Burgundian king. Jean then accompanied Llapa on a tour of Anvers, wrapping up the visit with a show of the internationally acclaimed royal gardens."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.13.a: "The Inka Puma and the Lion de Bourgogne go well together."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.14.t: "The King and the Emperor"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.14.d: "[concept_dvg_sapa_inka] [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_llapa').GetFullName] of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_inca').GetName] has recently been touring Europe, turning heads and drawing crowds across the continent. Anvers, however, held special significance to him, due to his acquaintance with King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]. The two have exchanged letters in the past, and Llapa is perhaps the only non-European monarch whom Jean sees as remotely comparable to himself."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.14.f: "Both Jean and the emperor's retainers were astounded when Llapa — having studied the languages of Burgundy thoroughly in preparation for his visit — not only greeted him in Burgundian but carried on most of their conversation in the language! The two of them discussed rulership, their personal lives, the most beautiful places in Burgundy and Tawantinsuyu, and their distaste for Catholics. The King's knowledge of architecture particularly impressed the Inca emperor. Jean then led Llapa on a tour of Anvers, wrapping up the visit with a show of the internationally acclaimed royal gardens."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.14.a: "The Lion de Bourgogne and the Inka Puma go well together."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.15.d: "[concept_dvg_sapa_inka] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has taken Europe by storm — in terms of popularity, that is. Crowds have gathered in Anvers, Paris, Copenhagen, and all the other great cities of the continent to behold the legendary Sapa Inka and his royal entourage."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.15.f: "European savages may be easily impressed, but the tremendous attention which Llapa and his officials received during their travels surprised even themselves. Whether riding a gondola in Venice, touring the fabulous gardens of Anvers, or cutting a sharp figure near St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, the Sapa Inka has caused more than a few Europeans to re-evaluate their views on the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.15.a: "They were starstruck!"

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.16.t: "Twin Realms of the Sun"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.16.d: "Over the past few days, the people of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_japan').GetName] have witnessed something extraordinary, the first-ever visit by an Inka Emperor! [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_llapa').GetFullName] of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_inca').GetName], as part of his diplomatic tour across Europe and the Pacific, recently concluded his visit to the Sunrise Kingdom."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.16.f: "The Sapa Inka surprised many with his good command of Japanese, though his excited fascination with Japanese art and culture was quite unconcealed. His reception in the imperial capital by Emperor [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_emperor').GetFullName] was quite noteworthy, a grand ceremony befitting the great rulers of the Pacific. Tawantinsuyu has long been a fixture in Japanese diplomatic and economic interchange, and this latest episode will only strengthen these bonds."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.16.a: "A marvelous conclusion of a magnificent journey."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.18.t: "The Return of the Sapa Inka"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.18.d: "After several months abroad, [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has finally returned home to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. He was received in a magnificent ceremony, with him and the royal family traveling on a special train from the port city of Uraycusta all the way back to [concept_dvg_cuzco]."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.18.f: "The experience has humbled the Sapa Inka, giving him insights on the nations of the world and challenging his conceptions of their peoples. Moreover, the cultural exposure which his court officials received in places as diverse as [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_burgundy').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_japan').GetName] is sure to influence the political and social developments in the Tawantinsuyu."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.19.t: "The Death of Llapa Yupanki"
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.19.d: "The [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] had fought to keep healthy over the last decade. The stress of rulership was great, but his will even greater. During his last years, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] and his imperial biographer held regular sessions in which, through dictation and interview, the Sapa Inka composed his final review of his own life."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.19.f: "Llapa expressed satisfaction at the reforms and modernization he brought about, but more importantly, in having cultivated an educated people who could inherit this prosperous realm. Llapa declared his memoirs finished last evening and went to sleep early. This morning it was discovered that he was not in his bed, and palace attendants searched the grounds. The Sapa Inka of modernity was found expired on the palace terrace, having awoken early and watched the sun rise over the mountains, his face an image of peace."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.20.f: "Though he seems to have made up his mind about entrusting the empire to his daughter, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_princess_kantu').GetFirstName], who he refers to in his memoirs as 'the future of the empire' and who is the closest to him in policy, this ascent is rejected by two factions of Inka nobles, who either favor the eldest son, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_prince_hurhi').GetFirstName], or his younger brother, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_prince_sinchi').GetFirstName].\n \nPrince [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_prince_hurhi').GetFirstName] is known as a religious firebrand, having close ties to the [concept_dvg_willaq_umu] and the nobles of the north, who engage in frequent conflicts against perceived Catholic infiltration. In his fiery speeches, Hurhi has made it clear he intends to continue his late father's projects of national unification, ensuring the realm is united as one under [concept_dvg_inti] and his mighty armies.\n \nPrince [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_prince_sinchi').GetFirstName], on the other hand, is a well-known populist, known for his frequent visits to the factory floor and to the neglected corners of the southeast. His agenda is one of welfare and cultural investments, hoping to integrate socialists and progressives ever more into the imperial system."

Still, with an audience comprised mainly of diplomatic envoys and representatives from the imperial [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('scope_trade_unions').GetName], the ceremonies went on."
 dvg_inca_path_llapa.21.f: "First, lamentations for Llapa Yupanki were observed. The participants then gathered in the Awkaypata, decorated with statues of [concept_dvg_inti] and other major gods and [concept_dvg_wak'a], where the ritual proceedings began. Their most important offerings were dedicated to the creator god Wiraqocha, whose aid was solicited in granting the empress great health, victory in battle, many children, and peace in her time. The anointed llamas were sacrificed and cremated along with the cloth, and the artifacts buried on Chuquicancha hill.\n \nIn a compromise with the conservatives, the Qoya was wed to her brother [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_prince_sinchi').GetFirstName], though he would not rise to be [concept_dvg_sapa_inka], rather remaining as a prince. In the following days, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] noticeably refrained from making public appearances, though several commandments emerged from the royal palace, putting into place a new ten-year plan, a diplomatic project for the annexation of the treaty ports, and even the commission of a scientific expedition to Antarctica."

The anointed llamas were sacrificed and cremated along with the cloth, and the artifacts buried on Chuquicancha hill. Yet, in the middle of the ceremonies, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_prince_hurhi').GetFirstName] shocked observers as he summoned the [concept_dvg_willaq_umu] before him, instructed him to kneel, and seized the clerical crown from his head.\n \nWearing the garments of the two most powerful men in the realm, the Sapa Inka delivered an impassioned speech, which international observers noted to resemble more a political rally than a solemn coronation, in which he announced plans for a great military modernization as well as a state of emergency meant to 'purge the realm of the enemies of Inti', received with raucous applause."

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.24.f: "News of the achievement was broadcast from [concept_dvg_cuzco] using our state-the-art radio towers, with citizens across the empire rejoicing at the success of the expedition.

 dvg_inca_path_llapa.25.f: "The maneuver is supported by former [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_llapa_yupanki').GetFirstName], who has grown frail and exhausted in his home arrest, and states that 'the light of Inti has passed down upon her'. Though many of the nobles are uncomfortable with the idea of a female ruler, they see this as the only way to restore their lost prestige. [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_sayri_rimaq').GetFirstName] and his republicans have so far remained silent on the matter, but many are fearful of the empire being plunged into destructive civil war once again."

To escape the debts he left his old life and took a ship to [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_atlantia').GetName], where he heard stories about the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Becoming fascinated, he traveled to our realm and presented himself as a military advisor. His worth was tested and proven in cavalry victories during the [concept_dvg_fifth_andine_war], and now once more in the struggle against Llapa Yupanki.

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.3.f: "Traditionally, the [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] is expected to spend a certain amount of their time conducting religious rituals at the Qurikancha, leading ceremonies by day and performing sacred astrology by night. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], however, has been neglecting his duties to focus on his military reforms and upcoming campaigns. This has caused unrest among the nobles of the capital, and the matter was eventually brought to the [concept_dvg_willaq_umu], the high priest himself.

In a personal meeting in Shinkillaqta, Samiri attempted to entretain the [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] with tales of ruins and archeological findings which did not catch the eye of the emperor who was never interested in history or pottery remains found in the mud. That was until Samiri gifted him the skull of a long-gone beast, a saber-toothed tiger which roamed the Intipmarka millennia ago.

Hoping to improve the lacking cartography of the region, he commissioned a scientific expedition into the jungle, which the [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] decided to lead personally."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.7.f: "For four weeks, the imperial retinue journeyed along the Amazon River, surrounded on both sides by a great wall of dense foliage, until they arrived at the hidden village of Ploumanao. The locals, descended from [SCOPE.sCulture('scope_breton').GetName] pirates, welcomed the group, having heard of the great Sapa Inka even in their isolated settlement. Washkar, while drunk, even decided to take part in a local Guren Contest, a traditional form of Breton wrestling in which the winners are awarded a sheep. Even though there are no sheep in the rainforest, the emperor liked his prize parrot so much he decided to grant the village a privileged status as an 'free imperial city' in the [concept_dvg_suyu]."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.7.a: "The depths of the jungle hold many secrets."

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.8.t: "Journey to the End of the Realm"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.8.d: "As [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is aware, everything is finite and this extends even to the Realm of the Four Corners. With the success of his recent expedition into the Amazon, the Sapa Inka summoned [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_fujimori').GetFullName] to plot an equally-grand southern expedition, seeking a mythical territory known to Beornian explorers as the Land's End."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.8.f: "After a month-long trek Washkar reached the so-called Land's End, really a meager collection of desolate islands, and at its southernmost point erected a shrine to [concept_dvg_inti], establishing this site as the end of his empire. Still unsatisfied, the Sapa Inka gazed across the southern sea. Remembering tales from his youth of a vast southern land of ice and snow, he delved into the freezing waters and proclaimed that one day his descendants will explore the southern continent, and that it shall be their new frontier." 
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.8.a: "And so he wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer."

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.9.t: "Sunset"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.9.d: "For weeks, imperial doctors begged [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] to allow them to examine him, fearing he had been either infected or poisoned. Yet Washkar refused, asserting he would overcome his sickness through strength of will, even as he gradually lost his voice."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.9.f: "This evening, Washkar finally expired roughly an hour after sunset. This marks the second death of a Sapa Inka in less than thirty years, a terrible situation for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. In theory, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_prince_tupac').GetFullName], Washkar's son, will succeed him. Yet the powerful [concept_dvg_amachaq] of the empire may have other plans, as the prince is young and unsure of himself. With regent [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_kosciuzko').GetFullName] struggling to retain power in [concept_dvg_cuzco] while his rivals make plans in the hinterlands, the fate of the empire falls into uncertainty once more."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.9.a: "To the strongest!"

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.10.t: "The Musuq Pacha"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.10.d: "Through shrewd negotiations and rapid political maneuvering, the [concept_dvg_amachaq] have managed to unite the empire peacefully. Celebrations abound across the Four Corners as young [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_prince_tupac').GetFullName] is crowned [concept_dvg_sapa_inka], heralding a new age for the Lands of the Sun."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.10.f: "Though their visions for the future of the empire greatly differed, the Amachaq were able to put their differences aside for the sake of peace. During the regency of [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_kosciuzko').GetFullName], a preliminary constituion was drafted, promising suffrage, personal liberties and civil rights to the citizens of the empire. Though parliamentarism is a sharp departure from the systems of divine autocracy which have governed the empire since its inception, many now see it as the best path forward to ensure prosperity for the peoples of the Andes."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.10.a: "Washkar's legacy is secured!"

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.11.t: "A Coup in Qusqu"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.11.d: "With years having gone by without the [concept_dvg_amachaq] being able to secure their power, [concept_dvg_cuzco] was subject to a palace coup by the hardliner bureaucrat [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_roqa_waqaq').GetFullName]. Having assassinated both young prince [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_prince_tupac').GetFirstName] and his retainer, Roq'a now seizes the imperial throne for himself."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.11.f: "A staunch defender of the old ways of the empire, Roq'a has denounced the Amachaq as 'foreign usurpers' and proclaimed himself the true son of [concept_dvg_inti]. With war threatening to tear apart the Four Corners, and shouts for revanchism among the Euro-Amerigans, no one knows what the future holds for the beleaguered children of Wiraqucha."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.11.a: "For tradition!"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.11.b: "For progress!"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.11.c: "For prosperity!"

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.11.g: "...for Ameriga!"

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.12.t: "Sunstorm"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.12.d: "Four centuries ago, [concept_dvg_pachacuti] ascended to the throne of [concept_dvg_cuzco], and thus our empire was born. Now, the journey we began alongside him has been completed by the only man to surpass him: [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], the Terror of the East."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.12.f: "After a series of decisive victories against the Amerigan barbarians, Washkar celebrated by summoning his inner circle, a group of eclectic figures known as the [concept_dvg_amachaq], to the royal palace in Qusqu. There they beheld the new order in the continent, drawing out borders and zones of influence along a map on a massive table. What the Sapa Inka did not then know was how many of these battle lines were being drawn within his own realm. Yet, as the imperial banners are raised across the Lands of the Sun, the darkness brought by the European invaders is finally receding."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.12.a: "And just as we vowed, the blazing rays of Inti illuminate all!"

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.13.t: "A Secret Meeting"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.13.d: "Over the course of his reign, [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] Washkar's reckless nature and disdain for tradition made him a pariah among the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('scope_inka').GetName]. Now that he is dead, regent [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_kosciuzko').GetLastName] finds himself surrounded by enemies, and must seek support in the unlikeliest of places."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.13.f: "Ever since his youth, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_sayri_rimaq').GetFullName] has hosted a constitutional club within the very center of the empire, [concept_dvg_cuzco] itself, his noble descent protecting him from state reprisal. Though the constitutionalists were once a negligible minority, the upheavals and political polarization resulting from Washkar's reign have bolstered them into a sizeable force on their own right. With nowhere else to turn, Kosciuzko agrees to a late-night meeting with Rimaq and his clique, in which they discuss a bold new idea for the future of the empire."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.13.a: "It's a risky move, but it could just work..."

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.14.t: "Courting the Western Noble"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.14.d: "In the aftermath of his meeting with the constitutionalists, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_kosciuzko').GetLastName] departed west towards the Pacific Coast, the domain of [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_fujimori').GetFullName], lord of merchants and sailors."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.14.f: "Kosciuzko and Fujimori were both first among the [concept_dvg_amachaq], having gained prominence within the imperial armed forces when Washkar was still a prince himself. Since then, Fujimori has risen to be the premier authority in naval matters, running his so-called 'Kutamasuyu' as an effective fiefdom, where the empire's traditional regulations on commerce and migration are little more than an afterthought. Though he was receptive to his comrade's parliamentarian project, Fujimori made it clear that his support, and his heaps of capital, came at a price: the liberalization of the imperial economy."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.14.a: "No price is too steep for peace!"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.14.b: "A price the regent was unwilling to pay..."

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.15.t: "Lessons from the Architect"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.15.d: "Seeking to gain further support for his parliamentary project, but also to escape the rising tensions of the capital, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_kosciuzko').GetLastName] found himself marching south into what once were the sleepy settlements of the [concept_dvg_qullasuyu], now a bustling cultural center under the care of [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_samiri').GetFullName]."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.15.f: "Samiri was quick to recognize the intent of Kosciuzko's visit, as the two men chatted over tea. Parliamentarism, the [concept_dvg_amachaq] thought, was not nearly as foreign a concept to the Andes as the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('scope_inka').GetName] claimed it to be, as ever more in his excavations he found evidence of egalitarian social structures in the Pre-Inkan [concept_dvg_aimara] lordships, knowledge the [concept_dvg_cuzco] nobility insists on suppressing in order to claim superiority over all Andine cultures. Supporting the constitution was a unique opportunity for Samiri, his chance to change the realm for the better, mixing the best elements of new and old."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.15.a: ""And, of course, you'd be granted the Ministry of Agriculture.""
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.15.b: "But he chose not to, preferring to dig for relics in the mud."

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.16.t: "The Light of Progress"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.16.d: "With the meetings in the west and south concluded, only one [concept_dvg_amachaq] remains: [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_cabral').GetFullName], the new lord of the north. Under his supervision, the barren and defiled lands of the [concept_dvg_chinchaysuyu] were risen to a privileged state in the empire, employing the latest in scientific techniques." 
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.16.f: "While most officials in the empire assumed there was little value in the infrastructure and technology of the northern barbarians, Cabral has instead repurposed them to the benefit of our realm. His tenure has seen large-scale industrial expansion in the region, building close ties with the [concept_dvg_chimu] population, famed for their metalworking. Despite being far from a religious man, Cabral has collaborated extensively with the clerical hospitals in providing medical care to rural communities, frequently assailed by smallpox. In his meeting with the regent, he argued extensively for the importance of ending hereditary governance, claiming that the short-sightedness of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('scope_inka').GetName] lords makes them blind to the greatest light of all: the light of progress."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.16.a: "Kosciuzko could only agree."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.16.b: "Blasphemy!"

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.17.t: "Invitation from the Jungle"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.17.d: "Though he thought the trip to the north had been the last of his campaigning, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_amachaq_kosciuzko').GetLastName] was surprised to find a letter awaiting on his desk upon his return to [concept_dvg_cuzco]. Indeed, there was one [concept_dvg_amachaq] he had not yet visited: [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_kuara_tiarayu').GetFullName], beleaguered governor of the [concept_dvg_antisuyu]."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.17.f: "Ever since the death of Washkar, Tiarayú had fallen into a deep depression. Confining himself away in his quarters for days on end, the Amachaq would then emerge with extremely-detailed maps of the Amazon basin, considering his cartography an act of service to the late emperor, meant to unite the realm in his name. When he and the regent met, Tiarayú espoused an appearance of total disrepair, so much so that Kosciuzko had him immediately brought to Qusqu to be treated to intensive care. After his recovery, the two men conversed, and the Amachaq's attitude changed dramatically. Standing before a massing of troops at the imperial palace, Tiarayú delivered an impassioned speech calling for the defense of the memory of Washkar Inka, and promoting Kosciuzko and parliamentary rule as the means through which the late emperor's legacy can be secured, against those petty lords who seek to usurp him."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.17.a: "Could it be enough?"

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.18.t: "Death is a New Beginning"
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.18.d: "“It is no easy task to ensure the coherent action of an ancient monarchy, a proud aristocracy, and a reformed constituency.

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.18.f: "Despite having relinquished his position of regent after the proclamation of the Musuq Pacha, Mikolaj Kosciuszko still held a great influence over the Imperial Assembly and politics at large. No [concept_dvg_inkap_rantin] was appointed before he agreed upon the choice, and the [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] always made sure to consult him on matters of governance.\n \nMikolaj died peacefully at a venerable age, with his body being mummified and buried in [concept_dvg_cuzco] while, at his request, his heart was sent to a mausoleum in his native Poland. In subsequent days, crowds of ambassadors and politicians have expressed their condolences for the late [concept_dvg_amachaq], with a solemn eulogy delivered by his political ally, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_sayri_rimaq').GetFullName], who many expect to ascend to the post of Inkap Rantin in the coming years."

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.19.d: "During the instability which followed the death of Washkar, the perfidious Arcadian barbarians were able to wrest control of the Galapagos Islands. Now that our empire has recovered from its times of crisis, we have the ability to strike back."
 dvg_inca_path_washkar.19.f: "Though some within our realm deride the conflict as a useless struggle over turtles and iguanas, several members of our government see great potential in this war, paricularly if we are able to take control of the Andagoya isthmus, which has in recent years been scouted as the prime location for a lucrative canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.\n \nThose of a more jingoist disposition even demand we claim lands as far as the Yucatan peninsula, ensuring our northern security while also presenting ourselves as the liberators of the oppressed, freeing the original inhabitants of the continent from centuries of colonialist domination."

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.20.f: "Staunchly opposed to Washkar's reforms and seeking a return of stability and tradition to the empire, Roq'a succeeded in defeating his rivals and consolidating his position in [concept_dvg_cuzco], where his power base resides. Despite this, the petty lineages from all the other corners of the empires look upon him with distrust, fearful of losing the autonomy they acquired during Washkar's reign.\n \nThus, the [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] ascends upon a weary throne, mutilated by centuries of never-ending war and strife, vowing to restore the righteous Inka way of life upon the loyal denizens of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], while bringing [concept_dvg_inti]'s wrath upon his foes."

 dvg_inca_path_washkar.21.f: "Few in Europe and Arcadia can believe that a former slave could rise to become emperor of the greatest power in [concept_dvg_ameriga], but so it has come to pass. After a grand coronaation ceremony in [concept_dvg_cuzco], which concluded with the execution of the would-be usurper, Roq'a Waqaq, the new [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] chose the regnal name of Yana Utunrunkunta, 'Black Panther', in rememberance of the beast which led to his encounter with Washkar so many years ago, and which the emperor now proclaims was a sign from [concept_dvg_inti] of his destiny to come.\n \nThe new Inka is known for his love of modern science and technology, as well as a deep hatred for the barbarous institution of slavery, and has proclaimed that all the resources of the empire will be destined to provide the oppressed peoples of the continent with liberty and prosperity."

A key part of his rule was touting Lotharingia as a 'land of economic opporunity', with his regime granting millions of European settlers their own plots of land, at the expense of the Guarani people who were expelled to 'reservations' in the harsh and desolate Hatun Chaku at the country's western frontier. With the toppling of his autocracy, the reorganization of these lands must now be decided on."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.6.a: "These new lands will be returned to their rightful, original owners — the Guarani people."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.6.b: "These lands will be split up into several small states, incapable of posing us a threat."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.7.t: "Reorganization of Amazonie"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.7.d: "For many years, the part of Ameriga known as 'Amazonie' had struggled on the question of race — the Antarctican Planteurs desired a segregated state with Whites ruling over an enslaved class of Black people, while the Equinoxien Jesuits sought a union of the races under Catholicism. Now, neither of them matter."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.7.f: "Upon the surrender of the Equinoxien and Antarctican forces, Antarctican leader Beaumont Cartier proclaimed he would fight until the bitter end as the 'Protector of the White Race' before being finally shot down while making a last stand at his sugar plantation. His Equinoxien counterpart, Robert Forestier, told his captors that his so-called God would punish us all right before he was executed at the very same church he preached at for decades.\n \nNow, with these firebrands gone, we have the opportunity to settle this question of race in our own way."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.7.a: "These new lands will be returned to their rightful, original owners — the Tupi people."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.7.b: "These lands will be split up into several small states, incapable of posing us a threat."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.8.t: "The Peace of Hullaqa"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.8.d: "Though both sides fought fiercely, neither the Coalition Armies nor those of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_TWT').GetName] were able to win a decisive victory. In the end, a peace summit was called in Hullaqa, where representatives of each nation compromised and split Ameriga into spheres of influence."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.8.f: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_LOT').GetAdjective] delegates were especially morose at this news, realizing that their western lands were now permanently out of their reach, but the other powers decided that securing peace was more important. While [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_washkar').GetFirstName] is privately disappointed that the chance to remake the continent in his image has been lost, he does not show it. Though peace has returned to the Amerigan continent, many remain unsure of how long it will last..."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.9.d: "Hundreds of years ago, Sapa Inca Pachacuti enlightened his people by teaching them of Inti and how best to give praise to the sun. Now, like Icarus of the Greek myth, the Incans flew too close to the sun and have been sent plunging into the abyss below."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.9.f: "The Armies of the Coalition defeated the Incan armies after a series of maneuvers along the frontier allowed them entry into the imperial heartlands. Sapa Inca [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_washkar').GetFirstName] was cornered by the Coalition armies near Lake Titicaca and perished while leading the final charge against them. After a relative of Washkar was hurriedly coronated as the new Sapa Inka, he was made to sign an exorbitant and punitive peace treaty. Tawantinsuyu has been dismembered, with its surrounding nations stripping away imperial lands. Those Inca lands which remain have been devastated by war."

This morning, the Mapuche were officially recognized by the [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] as an honored 'martial race'."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.20.f: "The announcement was made after a meeting between the Sapa Inka and [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_mapuche_toki').GetFullName], former Toki of the Confederation of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_WLM').GetName]. The tribal leader congratulated the emperor on his triumph over the Beornians, who his people had fought against many times before, and volunteered himself to lead a regiment of Mapuche warriors to assist the occupation of the newly-annexed lands, summoning those most skilled from both the eastern and western tribes. Though the Mapuche and the Inka have been fierce enemies in the past, Washkar recognized the honor and loyalty of the leader's request, granting the Mapuche a privileged status within the [concept_dvg_qullasuyu]. "
 dvg_inca_ameriga.20.a: "The peoples of the Andes stand united as one!"

 dvg_inca_ameriga.21.t: "The Clémenceau Affair"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.21.d: "Jean-Marie Clémenceau was an ordinary man by all measures: a destitute French veteran of the Peninsular War, he settled in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to train cavalry in exchange for money and was considered by all acquaintances a drunken mess. But one day, he taught [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] the sport of courte-paume, and so his luck changed."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.21.f: "He was soon granted a small governorship in the area of Hemingsbrough, the [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] thinking an European could perhaps instill discipline in the Beornians. But to his surprise, a Frenchman serving the empire was the sum of all Beornian fears. With his province in near open revolt after he publicly insulted Anglicanism while inebriated, Clémenceau fled under cover of night, taking with him the taxes he had levied in the name of the empire. Having successfully escaped to Europe, he would go on to spend all of his fortune on games, prostitutes, and alcohol, before being found dead in the gutter of a Parisian street three years later. Out of rage, Washkar had three blameless French advisors killed in retaliation and would forbid any from serving the empire in the future."

The old reciprocity principle, [concept_dvg_ayni], is seen by many socialists as an uniquely Andean societal development which wholly eliminates the need for the capitalist mode of production."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.14.f: "Outside of Blanquist doctrine, the allure of socialism has attracted many workers and peasants who still are fond of the imperial times when companies and foreign interests did not put them in misery and hunger.
