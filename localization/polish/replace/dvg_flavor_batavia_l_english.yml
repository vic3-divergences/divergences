 je_btv_military: "Structuring the military"
 je_btv_military_reason: "Since the start of Geuzen settlement, armed conflict has been handled exclusivley by Kommandos. While they have been effective so far in keeping their settlements safe without incurring costs to the state, the unification of Batavia has brought changes to the Cape. These militias are able to defend smaller regions and individual towns but theys are incapable of mustering an effective national defence throughout a vast, expanding country. We need to establish a formal institution to co-ordinate our armed forces to suit our needs. This leaves us with two options: reorganise the militias into larger regional army corps under the direction of the state. Or abolish the Kommando system alltogether and establish a formalised, European-style, professional army."
 je_btv_autocracy: "Question of the republic"
 je_btv_autocracy_reason: "The Geus are not known for their democratic tendencies. Most Geuzen polities have been ruled by autocrats that have legitimised their rule by stirring up fear of external opression and assuring their people that freedom will come once the present threats are dealt with. Many believe that time has come, and dreams of democratic institutions are being freely discussed in our cities. With more radical elements already drafting up plans for a representative body for our government. Although... democracy is not inevitable here. Even now, we are beset on all sides by aggressive tribes with no use for the land and resources they occupy. And was it not the strong leadership of past rulers that secured our independence from Burgundy? Providing the structure and development that turned a land of scattered settlements into a homeland for our people. The path we choose now will define what shape our instututions take, and how our government will move into the future."

 dvg_batavia.2.t: "Selecting a Capital"
 dvg_batavia.2.d: "Now that the roles of the government have been established, we must select a city for the government to be housed, to serve as our new capital."
 dvg_batavia.2.f: "Given the range states that have existed here we have a number of choices, each with their own merits. Dierickstadt, the home of the hardiest trekker militias. Ylnerdam, Aloysius' capital and staging point for his return to Ville du Cap. Niew Antwerpen, the birthplace of the Geuzen rebellion. Ville du Cap, the capital of the Burgundian colony, a fine trophy as our new capital. Or Vlinderveer, a fledgling city roughly in the centre of our nation, as a compromise with the other candidates."
