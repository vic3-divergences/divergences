  ### Europe

  BOH_NATION_SELECTION_LORE: "Ever since the wars of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], the [concept_dvg_holy_roman_empire] has fallen into a weakened and decadent state, with petty lords constantly squabbling against each other.

  DUA_NATION_SELECTION_LORE: "Ruled by the Plantagenet Dynasty ever since their victory in the [concept_dvg_hundred_years_war], the [concept_dvg_dual_monarchy] is a union of two unequal partners. In the courts of Paris and Londres, the [concept_dod_anglois] boast great wealth and ambitions. Though the country boasts a powerful economy, great cultural prestige, and a massive population, all of that could be for naught if the union fails to adapt to the Modern Age.\n"

  BAV_NATION_SELECTION_LORE: "The Kingdom of Bavaria is perhaps the only real winner of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], having confirmed its territorial gains against Austria in the 1820 [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris]. Perhaps because of this, the country maintains one of the most organized factions of Radicalists in Germany, constantly agitating against aristocratic privilege and for national unification.\n"
  BAV_NATION_SELECTION_PATHS: "Gameplay Hints:\n    - Form the Danubian Confederation\n    - Unify Germany"

  SPA_NATION_SELECTION_LORE: "Formed from of the union of the crowns of Portugal and Castille in the 15th century, the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire] was once an unmatched force, waging conquest and spreading Catholicism across all corners of the globe.

  ### Ameriga

  AMA_NATION_SELECTION_LORE: "Priding itself on being the first recognized democratic country in [concept_dvg_ameriga], Amazonie portrays itself as a beacon of liberty in the New World.

After years of conflict, the charismatic colonel Denis de Aigle managed to lead his faction to victory, establishing a personalistic dictatorship. Will the 'army with a state' of the National Liberateurs hold to become a shining example for its neighbors?, or is it doomed to collapse from corruption and nepotism?\n"

  BEO_NATION_SELECTION_LORE: "Beornia was founded by English settlers who travelled to [concept_dvg_ameriga] seeking to preserve their culture, far from the influence of the [concept_dod_anglois].
