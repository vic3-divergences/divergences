 ### Descriptions
  objectives_new_this_patch_desc: "Thank you for playing Victoria 3 Divergences!\nIn this screen you can see some of the countries which have received brand new content in the latest version of the mod. Have fun!"
  objectives_old_order_desc: "Revered emperors and privileged lordships, these countries are the epitome of 'l'Ancien Régime'. Though the throes of progress threaten them with decline, they must not fall! Embark on a crusade against this so-called 'modernity' and prove it to be no more than a passing fad, powerless before the might of tradition."
  objectives_mercantilists_desc: "With large navies and vast ambitions, these countries derive their wealth from their myriad trade routes and scattered outposts across the globe. And so long as that wealth flows, be that gold, fabric, or slaves, these states (and their rich) are sure to prosper. Go forth and rule the waves!"
  objectives_paternals_desc: "'Strong armies and secure borders' is these countries' maxim, for modernity must not be embraced, but carefully picked through by a gloved hand. It is only through this oversight, gentle yet firm like the care of a father, that our country may grow strong and avoid sickness. After all, what is a nation without a strong ruler?"
  objectives_revolutionaries_desc: "'Freedom, Equality and Brotherhood!' cry the oppressed masses across all corners of the world, for too long have they been subject to the whims of oppressors and tyrants. What these countries lack for in power, they more than make up for with the indomitable dedication of a populace certain that the Old Order is soon to be washed away. Provided, of course, that they do not collapse into infighting."
 
 ### New in this Patch
  objectives_new_this_patch_name_BAV: "Königreich Bayern"
  objectives_new_this_patch_desc_BAV: "#lore The Kingdom of Bavaria is perhaps the only real winner of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], having confirmed its territorial gains against Austria in the 1820 [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris]. Perhaps because of this, the country maintains one of the most organized factions of Radicalists in Germany, constantly agitating against aristocratic privilege and for national unification.\n\nIf Bavaria can manage its affairs and write a balanced constitution, then the path towards a United Germany lays straight ahead. However, if the kingdom fails to stabilize, it will become little more than a rump state, having lost its golden opportunity."

  objectives_new_this_patch_name_GRA: "Vice-Reino de Nova Granada"
  objectives_new_this_patch_desc_GRA: "#lore Seven years ago, the valiant [concept_dvg_de_herrera] made his stand against the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire] and declared the Independence of New Granada. Yet betrayal by his once-trusted comrades and intervention by the savage Incans resulted in his death during the [concept_dvg_fifth_andine_war], and Granada fell under the throes of empire once more.\n\nNow, years later, the Herrerists continue to organize rebellion in the hinterlands, with guerilla leader Guillermo de Blanco swearing to uphold his late leader's legacy. And as the Colombian Alliance mobilizes in the north, the Herrerian Revolution is sure to follow suit."

  objectives_new_this_patch_name_QUI: "Vice-Reino de Nova Toledo"
  objectives_new_this_patch_desc_QUI: "#lore New Toledo is something of an esoteric state, especially compared to its neighbors in New Granada. With the inability of the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire] to conquer Cuzco, the Northern Andes have become a land of perpetual conflict, where the Spanish Crown relies heavily on support from the [concept_dvg_chimu] lords to retain its presence.\n\nThough revolutionaries in the city of Quito attempted to join their Granadan counterparts during the [concept_dvg_fifth_andine_war], they were quickly overwhelmed. Thanks to the efforts of Dom Henrique Túpac, colonial rule was restored, though there are some who claim the governor holds a great ambition..."

  objectives_new_this_patch_name_PRO: "Royaume Provençal"
  objectives_new_this_patch_desc_PRO: "#lore The Kingdom of Provence is something of a haven for the lost royals of Europe, hosting both the Valois 'Kings-in-France' and the exiled Tuscan Medicis. Born out of the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_rome] which put an end to the [concept_dvg_hundred_years_war], its position as a French Catholic state in Protestant Occitania grows increasingly untenable.\n\nYet if Provence is able to beat the odds and triumph, it may just grow into a new European power. Between revanchist monarchs and ambitious generals, who knows what lays in store for the kingdom of the Alps?"

 ### The Old Order
  objectives_old_order_name_DUA: "Royaume-Uni"
  objectives_old_order_desc_DUA: "#lore The United Kingdom of France and England, or the '[concept_dvg_dual_monarchy]', is one of the most prestigious states in Europe. Forged in the flames of the [concept_dvg_hundred_years_war], the blessed Plantagenet dynasty has carefully steered the ship of state for over four centuries, expertly managing the interests of its myriad subjects.\n\nThough some claim the union to be 'obsolete', a 'feudal relic', we know this to be no more than vulgar perfidy! Our divine state has resisted the test of time, aging its foundations into a robust marble, and no passing fad such as this so-called nationalism will see it torn down."

  objectives_old_order_name_BOH: "Heiliges Römisches Reich"
  objectives_old_order_desc_BOH: "#lore The [concept_dvg_holy_roman_empire] needs no introduction. It is, after all, the premier nation of Europe, and its ruler the only one who can truly claim emperorship. Under the will of the Kaiser and the Electorate, the empire has survived into the Modern Age, even when the Radicalist barbarians sought to destroy it in their so-called '[concept_dvg_german_revolution]'.\n\nNow the fool [concept_dvg_dahlke] is dead, much like the bastard usurper [concept_dvg_ludwig], and our newly-crowned Kaiser Sigismund assumes his divine mantle as heir to [concept_dvg_wenceslaus]. Long live the King of the Romans! And long live the European Throne!"

  objectives_old_order_name_MUG: "Hindustān"
  objectives_old_order_desc_MUG: "#lore Considered one of the 'Gunpowder Empires' of the 16th century, the Mughal Empire once ruled over much of the Indian subcontinent, governing with tolerance and bureaucratic efficiency and becoming recognized for its prestige and patronage of the arts — including the construction of the legendary Taj Mahal.\n\nDespite this, times have changed for the Mughals, and though the Padishah is still seen by many as the rightful Emperor of India, his divine power fails to extend beyond the imperial capital in Delhi. Can Muslim rule in India survive?"

  objectives_old_order_name_FRS: "Dà Ming"
  objectives_old_order_desc_FRS: "#lore For three centuries the Ming were the undisputed sovereigns of China. Yet it was invasion by the barbarous Manchus and the betrayal of the peasant 'Shun dynasty' which led to their fall from grace. Now exiled to the island of Taiwan, the Emperor of Tungning has claimed the title of 'Phoenix Emperor', swearing to return to the mainland.\n\nUnlike the other so-called dynasties, we will not bend before foreigners, be they European or Japanese! Rather, our Self-Strengthening Movement and Confucian tradition is all we need to bring back noble and righteous governance."

  ### The Mercantilists
  objectives_mercantilists_name_JAP: "Dai Nippon Teikoku"
  objectives_mercantilists_desc_JAP: "#lore All European merchants heading to the East know to relish at the sight of ships bearing the flag of [concept_dvg_japan]. After all, the Red Seal System and its anti-piracy measures ensure the personal oversight of the Emperor should any disputes arise the in the Pacific Ocean, an area now known to many as the 'Japanese Lake'.\n\nEven then, there are those who chafe at this surveillance, finding it hard to compete with the privileged status of goods produced in the Home Islands. They are bandits, of course, and so long as no new canals are opened, the Pacific shall remain our imperial monopoly."

  objectives_mercantilists_name_SCA: "Kalmarunionen"
  objectives_mercantilists_desc_SCA: "#lore With naval heritage owed back to the North Sea Empire and the Viking Expeditions to Vinland, it is only natural that the Arch-Kingdom of [concept_dvg_scandinavia] would become the foremost naval power of the Modern Age. Its interests reach from one pole to another, with colonists and missionaries laying claim to myriad territories, be they in Patagonia or the Pacific.\n\nSupplementing these ambitions is a mighty industry, fueled by the deep reserves of Scottish coal, as well as an economy furnished by cash crops from Caribbean plantations and the mighty profits of the slave trade. Yet this growing capitalist class has ambitions of its own, and won't bear aristocratic domination much longer."

  objectives_mercantilists_name_QIN: "Qingqiu Liánhé Huì"
  objectives_mercantilists_desc_QIN: "#lore The Federation of Qingqiu claims for itself the mantle of heirs to [concept_dod_zheng_he]. After declaring independence from the Empire of [concept_dvg_japan], the League of Traders, Shipwrights and Warehouses now forms a majority in the Confederal Yuan, defending a state organized on the Neo-Mengzist principles of free trade and local autonomy.\n\nThough they are still a young state, fearing invasion by the Japanese or the Colombians, the Qingqiuese may yet be able to assert themselves as an economic powerhouse, hosting vast resources and a hard-working population. Their range in the Pacific already extends as far as Hawaii, or the islands of 'Fang Hu', and soon this ocean will no longer be known as the 'Japanese Lake'."

  objectives_mercantilists_name_VEN: "Repùblega de Venexia"
  objectives_mercantilists_desc_VEN: "#lore Since medieval times, the Most Serene Republic of Venice has been the Queen of the Mediterranean, controlling the flow of trade across the sea, a state of affairs which brought its Patricians much wealth and prestige. Yet as the 19th century approaches, they risk being overshadowed by the growing presence of Aragon or subsumed by Italian nationalists.\n\nHowever, not all is yet lost for Venice, as their continued patronage of Roman rebels against the Great Turk gives them a strong presence in the Balkans. By the cautious hand of the Doge, Venice will carve for itself a new dominion and prosper through the centuries beyond!"

  ### The Paternalists
  objectives_paternals_name_BRG: "Royaume de Bourgogne"
  objectives_paternals_desc_BRG: "#lore Though the Kingdom of [concept_dvg_burgundy] is indisputably the most powerful nation in the world, it suffers from a festering illness of passivity and corruption. In the wake of a series of weak monarchs, who preferred to delegate tasks to Parliament instead of assuming their royal duties, Oligarchs from the [concept_dod_voc] have carved out the nation between themselves and now scheme to sell out its sovereignty to the highest bidder.\n\nNo more! Already whispers abound in the streets of a mighty hero, a Philosopher-King of the Modern Era, come to deliver upon the realm to its rightful claim of Master of Europe. The New Order awaits!"

  objectives_paternals_name_PLA: "Royaume Plantagenet"
  objectives_paternals_desc_PLA: "#lore The Kingdom of Plantagenia is akin to a house divided, nearly collapsing under its own weight and weak foundations. Defined by its 'peculiar institution' of slavery, political power is entirely concentrated in the hands of the [concept_dvg_planteur]. Though the young King Louis has different ideas.\n\nSince his youth, Louis has been a child of the [concept_dvg_enlightenment] and a lover of the open range, preferring to spend his time riding alongside Cowboys and Indians instead of rubbing elbows with Lords in Nouvelle-Orléans. Now, as tensions rise along the Belgian border, it's made clear that the Cowboy King's golden hour is fast approaching."

  objectives_paternals_name_TWT: "Tawantinsuyu"
  objectives_paternals_desc_TWT: "#lore Some say the social structure of the [concept_dvg_incan_empire] is much like the mountains it resides upon: a sharp pyramid. And who could reign from atop that pyramid but the Son of the Sun himself?\n\nUnlike the petty lords of Europe, the [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] is a benevolent and enlightened ruler, who cares for his subjects much as he would his own children. Though the Spanish barbarians lurk in the north, all loyal subjects know it is only a matter of time before the empire reclaims its glory and gets its groove back on."

  objectives_paternals_name_LOT: "État Lotharingien"
  objectives_paternals_desc_LOT: "#lore After gaining its independence from [concept_dvg_burgundy], the Lotharingian Republic failed to find its footing, instead becoming stage to a brutal civil war between myriad factions seeking control for themselves. From this struggle arose Chef Denis de Aigle, Father of the Nation.\n\nUnder his firm yet loving rule, we have prospered, and stability finally returned to these war-torn lands. Yet we must not dawdle, for the enemies of the state are many, and could lurk across any corner, be them imperialist spies or savage Incan raiders. Hail to the Chef!"

  ### The Revolutionaries
  objectives_revolutionaries_name_GCO: "Aliança Colombiana"
  objectives_revolutionaries_desc_GCO: "#lore Formerly the Viceroyalty of New Spain, the Colombian Revolutionaries rose up in Mexico City during the weakness of the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire] brought about by the [concept_dvg_peninsular_war]. Though the pan-national interests of the Colombians differ from the regionalist Lusitanians and Salvadoreans, for now an alliance has been forged between Caudilhos to cast off the Spanish Yoke.\n\nAfter expelling the colonial garrisons, the Alliance now exists as a partially-recognized state, yet also an example of freedom in the New World. With the imperialists preparing to resume the conflict, the free peoples of Colombia must rally their might to forge a new Colossus of the West, or else collapse into irrelevance."

  objectives_revolutionaries_name_ATL: "République Atlantien"
  objectives_revolutionaries_desc_ATL: "#lore Ever since the discovery of vast gold reserves in Atlantian territory, once considered little more than a backwater, the region has become known as the 'Crown of [concept_dvg_ameriga]'. After several inconclusive colonial wars, Atlantia was placed under international mandate, with each European power electing delegates to the Golden Board.\n\nSince the 18th century, the gold rushes have directed millions of migrants to the ports of Atlantia, turning the region into a cultural melting pot. And those who manage to hit the jackpot become part of the powerful Nouveau-Riche, agitating for independence and dreaming of a continental republic founded on [concept_dvg_enlightenment] values."

  objectives_revolutionaries_name_TUS: "Repubblica Etrusca"
  objectives_revolutionaries_desc_TUS: "#lore Though Republicanism in Italy is not a new concept, the Etrurian Republic enshrines in its constitution several values horrifying to the powers of Europe: liberalism, nationalism, and revolutionary action. Born as an Italian sibling to the Reichsrepublik of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], the Etrurians have endured where their older brother has fallen, and hold onto revolutionary customs to this day.\n\nThreatened by the revanchist aims of its former Medici overlords, now exiled in the Kingdom of Provence, Etruria will show the world that the European Revolution is not dead yet, for Italy must be united! O Roma o Morte!"

  objectives_revolutionaries_name_YLO: "Yaluo Liánsài"
  objectives_revolutionaries_desc_YLO: "#lore Formed via a miner's strike in the [concept_dod_kongsi] of Southern [concept_dod_zhourao], the League of Yaluo is a young republic still struggling to find its footing. Despite this, they are also the only ones in the continent to form alliance with the [concept_dod_hongshan], and several secret societies in the north have sworn to 'follow the example of Yaluo'.\n\nThough they are threatened from all directions, with both European colonists and other Chinese states longing for the destruction, the proud citizens of Yaluo shall not give in! Through the might of the National Revolutionary Army, they shall keep fighting until the continent is united under one banner. For Free Zhourao!"
