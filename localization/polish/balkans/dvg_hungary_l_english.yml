  dvg_hungary.1.t: "The State of the Lands of the Szent Korona"
  dvg_hungary.1.d: "The Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen were a battleground between the Jagiellons and the Turks for centuries. Transylvanian Prince Janos II Kemény, descended from the great Hunyadis, was briefly the king of Hungary, Moldavia, and Wallachia in the seventeenth century, but was defeated by simultaneous attacks from the Empire, Poland, and the Turks. The Great Turkish War of the 18th century and the [concept_dvg_german_revolution] decades later allowed us to eventually oust both powers and win our freedom."
  dvg_hungary.1.f: "Now we find ourselves within an interregnum, with Prince Krisztofer Kemény of Transylvania the leading candidate. However he is a liberal, half-Rumanian Protestant, and unpopular outside of his homeland. Article XVIII of the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris] forbids any Jagiellon from ruling Hungary, yet they refuse to return the Szent Korona, vital to Magyar kingship. With our borders temporarily secure, the eastern Protestant and western Catholic magnates are bickering over whether to support Krisztofer or search for someone else."
  dvg_hungary.1.a: "Atoning sorrow hath weighed down sins of past and future days…"

  dvg_hungary.2.t: "Tensions in Nitra"
  dvg_hungary.2.d: "Some western magnates have begun to begrudgingly accept that Krisztofer's pedigree and personal charisma make him the best choice for the throne. Others have not."
  dvg_hungary.2.f: "One holdout in particular is Duke Gábor IV Zápolya of Nitra, a fiery Catholic zealot of Croatian and Moravian blood whose ancestors fought under the Papal banner in the anti-Hussite crusades. Gábor, denouncing Krisztofer's lack of the Szent Korona and “failure to reclaim” Turkish-held Temesköz, demands that Emperor Sigismund V be crowned instead! This is despite the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris] explicitly forbidding a Jagiellon to rule Hungary, not to mention the fact that we are in no condition to attack the Turks…and yet, Sigismund holds both a claim and the Szent Korona. Hungarian law states that the crown itself is a legal person identical to the state of Hungary and superior to the ruling monarch, who rules "in the name of the crown.” No king is truly legitimate without it - yet enthroning the Emperor would create an international catastrophe and would spark a war beyond reckoning."
  dvg_hungary.2.a: "Krisztofer is the rightful king, even if the Szent Korona is in Prague!"

  dvg_hungary.3.t: "The King of the Hungarian Nation"
  dvg_hungary.3.d: "Duke Gabor IV's scheme to install Emperor Sigismund V as King of Hungary forced our hand. We could no longer wait for the return of the Szent Korona."
  dvg_hungary.3.f: "The House of Kemény thus convinced a bare minimum quorum of magnates to support Krisztofer's kingship through bribery and blackmail. To that end, an emergency meeting of the Hungarian Diet was convened in Buda, where, in a solemn ceremony, Prince Krisztofer Kemény of Transylvania was acclaimed “King of the Hungarian Nation,” an archaic but technically sufficient title. This is a temporary measure to award him sorely needed legitimacy until the Szent Korona is returned and he can be properly coronated. Unfortunately, this desperate act has allowed the Duke of Nitra to rally Catholic magnates to his cause by denouncing the procedure as a sham and the new King Krisztofer to be illegitimate. All of Upper Hungary is now awash with reaction, especially among the magnates who refused to attend the Diet."
  dvg_hungary.3.a: "Long live the TRUE king!"

  dvg_hungary.4.t: "The Nitran Conspiracy"
  dvg_hungary.4.d: "Duke Gabor IV's insubordination has increased in scope. He is now believed to be recruiting support among the western and northern magnates, as well as the Catholic clergy, to contest King Krisztofer's legitimacy."
  dvg_hungary.4.f: "While ordinarily we would arrest him for treason against the monarch, our nation is barely keeping together as it is, and attempting to imprison a duke so popular with the Catholic clergy and the nobility could ignite a civil war. Therefore we are doing our best to keep an eye on the Duke. As of late he has been hosting guests from all over the Catholic regions of Hungary - we presume that he is building support to contest the King's rule. We cannot be certain of how many of his acquaintances have agreed to join his cause, but the possibility of insurrection at least in Upper Hungary in the near future must be considered."
  dvg_hungary.4.a: "Duke Gabor brings shame to the House of Zápolya!"

  dvg_hungary.5.t: "The Looming Disaster"
  dvg_hungary.5.d: "The House of Jagiellon claimed the Kingdom of Hungary ever since it slipped from our grasp in the 15th century. We made various attempts to reclaim it, but Article XVIII of the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris], which ended the wars of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], forbade any Jagiellon to rule Hungary."
  dvg_hungary.5.f: "Now it appears that the matter may be reignited. Duke Gábor IV Zápolya of Nitra is a fervent Catholic who despises the current King, Krisztofer Kemény (descendant of Janos II Kemény who briefly ruled Hungary, Moldavia, and Wallachia). Krisztofer is a liberal, half-Rumanian Protestant from Transylvania, and thus quite controversial. Furthermore, it is we, not Krisztofer, who hold the Holy Crown of Hungary, without which no man can legally rule the kingdom. Krisztofer was forced to take the title of “King of the Hungarian Nation” just to claim any form of legitimacy. It is well-known that the Duke, who is himself part Moravian, admires Sigismund and wishes that he would rule Hungary. Yet such a blatant violation of the Treaty of Paris could ignite an international crisis."
  dvg_hungary.5.a: "Let us hope, then, that they are simply rumors…"

  dvg_hungary.6.t: "The Rogue Diet of Nitra"
  dvg_hungary.6.d: "Duke Gabor IV has decided to act. It is now clear that he was indeed recruiting conspirators for a plot against the monarchy, a conspiracy which has moved into action in Nitra City. There, Hungarian magnates and bishops from across the Catholic heartland have convened to hold an illegal and unrecognized Diet."
  dvg_hungary.6.f: "At this meeting, the Duke and his conspirators first declared Krisztofer's acclamation as “King of the Hungarian Nation” to be legally meaningless, and then recognized Emperor Sigismund V as King of Hungary! We were unable to prevent word of this supreme treason from reaching Prague, and are now preparing for the worst. Martial law has been declared across Upper Hungary, and we must prepare for the possibility of civil war or even an invasion by the Holy Roman Empire to place its ruler upon our throne."
  dvg_hungary.6.a: "Judas!"

  dvg_hungary.7.t: "A Dangerous Crown"
  dvg_hungary.7.d: "Our suspicions as to the plans of Duke Gabor IV of Nitra have been confirmed. The disgruntled Duke and other aggrieved Hungarian magnates have convened an unauthorized Diet in Nitra City. There the Duke, and the Archbishop of Pozsony, led the conspirators in recognizing Emperor Sigismund V as King of Hungary!"
  dvg_hungary.7.f: "They followed this by requesting that the Emperor bring the Szent Korona and the Reichsarmee south into Hungary, where the magnates shall join forces with him and march to battle against Krisztofer. Sigismund had almost ordered the Reichsarmee to be marshalled before Chancellor Karl von Schwartzenberg reminded him that Article XVIII of the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris] explicitly forbade any Jagiellon to rule Hungary. This matter has now reached beyond a mere regional dispute, as it is almost certain that agents of the Scandinavian or Burgundian crown within Prague are on their way back to their masters to relate news of this escalating crisis.#R  If they choose to strike preemptively then we could be facing a new Great German War. #!"
  dvg_hungary.7.a: "We will not back down!"

  dvg_hungary.8.t: "Scandinavia Catches Wind of the Crisis"
  dvg_hungary.8.d: "The standoff with the Duke of Nitra and his legion of traitors has only grown more complicated. Word of their appeal to Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund V has now reached the ears of Scandinavia, supposedly by way of an intercepted letter from one of the magnates to a relative in the Imperial court."
  dvg_hungary.8.f: "While not quite as obvious a piece of evidence as the actual offer of the crown, we believe that it holds enough information about the Upper Hungarian conspiracy that Scandinavia will be able to piece together the other details. The result is that we may soon see this matter escalate from a regional concern into a continental crisis."
  dvg_hungary.8.a: "Damned treasonous rats!"

  dvg_hungary.9.t: "Bohemian Perfidy"
  dvg_hungary.9.d: "The [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris], which ended the devastating wars of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution] in 1820, forced the Bohemians to surrender their claim to Hungary. But once again, the House of Jagiellon has overstepped its bounds in its hunger for power."
  dvg_hungary.9.f: "News has reached us that the Duke of Nitra and a group of northern Hungarian magnates have acclaimed Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund V as King of Hungary! This is a direct violation of Article XVIII of the Treaty of Paris and would result in the Bohemians accumulating an unacceptable level of power, which they would surely use to strip our German-speaking lands from us. Therefore we must bring him to justice! The military has been placed on alert and word has been sent to our allies in Burgundy to prepare for another war on the fields of Germany."
  dvg_hungary.9.a: "Together we shall punish the criminal emperor!"

  dvg_hungary.10.t: "Scandinavia Warns of a Crisis in Hungary"
  dvg_hungary.10.d: "Dire news has reached us from Copenhagen: Scandinavia has caught wind of a conspiracy between Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund V and a group of Hungarian magnates led by the Duke of Nitra to recognize Sigismund as King of Hungary!"
  dvg_hungary.10.f: "This is an explicit breach of Article XVIII of the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris] which ended the devastating wars of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution] in 1820 and forced the Jagiellons to annul their claim to Hungary. If the Emperor assumes control of Hungary then their power in Europe would rival that of the Dual Monarchy and they could even attempt to centralize the Empire, just as the mad [concept_dvg_dahlke] or Sigismund's own father attempted in the past. This cannot be tolerated! The whole Burgundian military is on edge as our ministers come to the ghastly conclusion that we are on the edge of a Second Great German War."
  dvg_hungary.10.a: "If it's a fight that Sigismund wants…! Declare general mobilization!"

  dvg_hungary.11.t: "Our Friends in Paris"
  dvg_hungary.11.d: "Scandinavia has somehow caught wind of Duke Gabor IV's offer of the Hungarian crown to Emperor Sigismund V and is outraged at our breach of the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris]. Their military is already mobilizing in preparation for an invasion to force us to back down and Burgundy, their closest ally, is preparing the same!"
  dvg_hungary.11.f: "Our only hope now is to prevail upon our own ally, the Dual Monarchy, to intervene and prevent a continental war. It seems likely that they will insist upon a diplomatic solution, which would prevent Scandinavia and Burgundy from imposing any sort of settlement upon us. All eyes now turn to the Anglois, to prevent Europe from plunging back into carnage."
  dvg_hungary.11.a: "May the Bridge over Salzach still stand."

  dvg_hungary.12.t: "The Hungarian Crisis"
  dvg_hungary.12.d: "Burgundian, Scandinavian, be Imperial diplomats have all been meeting with the Foreign Minister regarding a monstrous political snarl. The trouble originated with the conservative Catholic Duke of Nitra, who rallied dissatisfied Hungarian magnates to recognize Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund V as King of Hungary and encouraged him to depose Hungary's liberal Protestant king."
  dvg_hungary.12.f: "This is a direct breach of Article XVIII of the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris] which ended the devastating wars of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution] in 1820. Burgundy and Scandinavia have become apoplectic at the notion of Sigismund breaking the Treaty and seizing Hungary, and are mobilizing for war against the Empire. It now falls to us to use our influence to prevent such a cataclysm. We have notified all three powers that a new congress shall be held in neutral Venice to iron out the matter or else we will intervene in the war. There shall not be a second Great German War on our watch."
  dvg_hungary.12.a: "Once again, we must be the stewards of the continent."

  dvg_hungary.13.t: "Paris Demands Restraint!"
  dvg_hungary.13.d: "An urgent missive from the Dual Monarchy has been received regarding the stirrings of war in Central Europe. They have, in the most diplomatic terms, strongly urged all parties - especially Burgundy and Scandinavia - to stand down and attempt negotiation before resorting to force."
  dvg_hungary.13.f: "For this purpose they have proposed to hold a new diplomatic Congress in the neutral city of Venice to iron out the matter and give all nations involved a say in the situation's resolution. This is more of a demand than a request, and rather than enter into open war with multiple European powers, including the Plantagenets, we should take this opportunity to prevent a new Great German War from erupting."
  dvg_hungary.13.a: "Very well, if we must…"

  dvg_hungary.14.t: "A Delegation from the Commonwealth"
  dvg_hungary.14.d: "The Serene Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania has always been subject to foreign meddling in internal and external affairs - with the Sejm always viewed as a pawn to the whims of the Bohemians and Scandinavians, leaving no semblance of authority to the monarch whatsoever."
  dvg_hungary.14.f: "The Commonwealth is in a tight leash to the ambitions of either side - be it of territorial, internal, or diplomatic purpose. However, with their interest in keeping the “peace” in Central Europe once more - or so they say, they have reached out to the Burgundian embassy in Warsaw, asking for permission to partake in the upcoming Congress."
  dvg_hungary.14.a: "A useful pawn is still useful, we accept."
  dvg_hungary.14.b: "Hmm… no."

  dvg_hungary.15.t: "The Ottoman Delegation"
  dvg_hungary.15.d: "The long stagnant yet enduring Sublime State still holds considerable sway in the Mediterranean and the Balkans despite being weakened due to internal dissent and foreign meddling."
  dvg_hungary.15.f: "The crippling losses brought upon by the Holy League in the 17th century were a disgrace to the Ottomans, with many Ottoman irredentists seeing this event as a prelude to the “Tumultuous Age” with the loss of Hungary and their other Balkan holdings. There is no denying that the Ottomans will bring these matters forth as one final attempt to regain their credibility with the Great Powers, but is the Sick Man still decisive enough to hold any sway in the grander scheme of things?"
  dvg_hungary.15.a: "If this merits peace and stability, then we accept."
  dvg_hungary.15.b: "It's best we leave the Sick Man of Europe to rot."

  dvg_hungary.16.t: "The Austrian Opportunity"
  dvg_hungary.16.d: "Karl von Schwartzenberg, the Austrian Foreign Minister, has come up with proposals to defuse this “terrible” and “dreary” situation on behalf of all Danubians in the Empire."
  dvg_hungary.16.f: "Despite being a complete neophyte in the field of foreign relations and diplomacy, he is mostly known for his rather “trickster-like” attitude in managing day-to-day foreign and state affairs which earned him popularity among affluent Austrians and Danubians alike in the Empire. Giving him this opportunity would surely gain the ire of the Bavarians wary of Austrian attempts to break their Danubian hegemony, but who else do we have to beckon nevertheless?"
  dvg_hungary.16.a: "Very well, give him the green light."
  dvg_hungary.16.b: "We respectfully decline."

  dvg_hungary.17.t: "Von Schwartzenberg's Proposal"
  dvg_hungary.17.d: "The atmosphere in Munich has taken a turn for the worse with the arrival of von Schwartzenberg, the Austrian Foreign Affairs Minister. He has requested to represent both of our nations in the current crisis of Hungary."
  dvg_hungary.17.f: "With our citizens still on edge with the news of the Saxon Incident, they too hope for a silver lining for the days to come. He has promised his full and unwavering support for defusing tensions in the Empire but our bellicose statesmen recognizes this as a move to further Austrian interests, threatening our Danubian hegemony. Given that Burgundy has directly invited Austria in this noble yet insidious endeavor, is this really worth the trouble?"
  dvg_hungary.17.a: "If this “proposal” brings stability and peace, then we accept"
  dvg_hungary.17.b: "Sensible? Opportunistic, more like. Never."

  dvg_hungary.18.t: "The Bavarians Decline!"
  dvg_hungary.18.d: "An outrage! The Austrian Foreign Affairs Minister has been disgracefully booted out from Bavaria by royal decree due to the intervention of conservative politicians at the behest of the Wittelsbachs."
  dvg_hungary.18.f: "They allege that us Austrians will use this as an opportunity to strengthen their hold on Danubian affairs and put them on “equal” and bellicose footing with Bavarian affairs and ambitions. Whatever their ramblings may be, it seems that they have passed up a one-of-a-kind deal that would bring stability to Imperial affairs once again."
  dvg_hungary.18.a: "Have they failed to see the light?"

  dvg_hungary.20.t: "Invitation to the Hungarian Conference"
  dvg_hungary.20.d: "The recent deposition of the King of Hungary by nobles and the offering of the vacant throne to Sigismund V of the Holy Roman Empire were met with animosity in Scandinavia and Burgundy."
  dvg_hungary.20.f: "After all, Article XVIII of the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris], which ended the wars of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], explicitly forbade any member of the Empire's ruling House of Jagiellon to be King of Hungary. A new European Congress has been called in Venice, Paris being deemed too biased for the Bohemians to be accepted by Burgundy and Scandinavia. We have also been invited to the conference where the fate of central Europe will be decided."
  dvg_hungary.20.a: "Great, some leisure time in Venice!"

  dvg_hungary.21.t: "The Opening of the Congress of Venice"
  dvg_hungary.21.d: "After weeks of preparations and travel, all diplomats and princes invited to address the Hungarian crisis have arrived in Venice. The Serenissima was chosen as a neutral venue after several others were ruled out: Salzburg, Anvers, Paris - all places too partial to one party."
  dvg_hungary.21.f: "The various delegations are being hosted by the great Patrician families of the city and dazzling celebrations and fireworks over the Piazza San Marco have marked the arrival of the last diplomats. Venetian authorities have been careful to place hostile parties at opposite ends of the city to avoid any incidents over the course of the conference, and the protocol for the Congress' opening has been discussed and reworked countless times. After a mass celebrated in the Saint Mark Basilica by the Patriarch, the diplomats have headed towards the Ducal Palace where the discussions shall start."
  dvg_hungary.21.a: "Will peace prevail?"

  dvg_hungary.22.t: "The Imperial Speech"
  dvg_hungary.22.d: "“The House of Jagiellon was long the steward of the Lands of the Holy Crown of Saint Stephen before they passed from the map of Europe."
  dvg_hungary.22.f: "Now that they have returned, the honorable gentlemen of Hungary have made plain the will of the people. We remind the delegates that this crown was not sought out by the Emperor, but given freely by a collection of sagacious men of high standing. Hungary finds herself in a delicate position, beset by internal turmoil which none have to this date succeeded in quieting. It is not surprising, then, that the good Duke of Nitra and his comrades have turned to the German Empire and its Jagiellon primus inter pares to find the stability which the Hungarian realm has recently lacked. His Majesty the Emperor of the Germans and King of Bohemia desires not to seek agglomeration for its own sake, but to calm the fey mood which has swept up the whole Hungarian nation…”"
  dvg_hungary.22.a: "Obviously."

  dvg_hungary.23.t: "The Ottoman Speech"
  dvg_hungary.23.d: "The Bohemian delegation was the first to speak. They advanced absurd arguments to justify their claim upon the Hungarian throne, making no mention of the fact that doing so was a clear breach of the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris]."
  dvg_hungary.23.f: "This was expected by the Ottoman delegation, which had long been contemplating the tone to set with their remarks. The majority felt that since Hungary was still claimed de jure by the Ottoman Sultan, the Ottoman delegation should immediately castigate the Jagiellons for their efforts to subvert the Treaty of Paris and usurp rightful Ottoman lands. However, more cautious diplomats were conscious that, the righteousness of the Sultan's cause aside, reigniting our ancient rivalry with the Holy Roman Empire would compromise their position, and we should instead phrase themselfs as defending established laws. By the time the discussion was over, it was decided that…"
  dvg_hungary.23.a: "Sigismund would get no sympathy from the Ottomans."
  dvg_hungary.23.b: "The Ottomans would focus their words only on upholding the Treaty of Paris."

  dvg_hungary.24.t: "The Scandinavian Speech"
  dvg_hungary.24.d: "“We are greatly disquieted to find that, so soon after the guns of Europe had been quieted through the cooperation of the great states of the continent, the specter of war once more haunts us all. Let none of us forget the lost generation of young men who laid down their lives so that we might free ourselves from the barbarous tyranny of internecine bloodshed.”"
  dvg_hungary.24.f: "“This Congress was convened in the spirit of magnanimity and with the highest aspirations, that we might ratify not simply a new peace, but an everlasting bond of fidelity between the nations. The Treaty of Paris was devised towards this end, a landmark of history, the dividing point between an age of chaos on the one hand, and an age of dignity and rationality on the other. An opportunity lies before us all, to build a new European order on a foundation of concord. It is only natural that our fair country should find herself at the head of this great wave…”\n\nThe Scandinavian delegation made a rather forgettable series of remarks which all revolved around upholding the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris] and preventing a new Great German War. While it held emotional appeals, it ultimately amounted to little practical substance. Most other delegates quickly dismissed it as mere pablum in service of a so-called “new European order” which the Scandinavians envisioned as being led by themselves."
  dvg_hungary.24.a: "Peace will prevail in the world."
  dvg_hungary.24.b: "Next!"

  dvg_hungary.25.t: "The Burgundian Speech"
  dvg_hungary.25.d: "Most observers expected the Burgundian delegation to follow the Scandinavian line of upholding the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris] and building a “new European order” founded on diplomacy rather than warfare - an implicit attempt to block Imperial expansion."
  dvg_hungary.25.f: "As they are Scandinavia's most prominent ally in Europe, this is a logical assumption. However, it is not their only option. Scandinavia currently holds Pomerania, a land once ruled by the Jagiellons and long coveted by them. Emperor Sigismund V's desire to reclaim it as part of his desire to rebuild the Jagiellon position within the Holy Roman Empire is well known. If they were to subtly undercut Scandinavia's arguments with their own remarks, while still demanding the Treaty of Paris and in particular Article XVIII be upheld, it could set the stage to draw Sigismund into giving up Hungary in favor of Pomerania, and a free Hungary could be a good ally in the Balkans. Having considered this the burgundian remarks…"
  dvg_hungary.25.a: "Emphasized our commitment to peace in Europe."
  dvg_hungary.25.b: "Made it clear that Scandinavia's posturing was unacceptable."

  dvg_hungary.26.t: "The Polish-Lithuanian Speech"
  dvg_hungary.26.d: "Of all the countries in attendance at the Congress of Venice, with the possible exception of the Dual Monarchy, Poland has the greatest interest in supporting the Bohemian position. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has long been supported by the Empire against Scandinavia and the Ottomans, not to mention the origins of the House of Jagiellon in our own lands."
  dvg_hungary.26.f: "However, the latest Sejm has underscored the divide within the Commonwealth between the pro-Bohemian faction, the pro-Scandinavian faction, and the pro-Hungarian faction. Thus while most expected the delegation to follow the whims of our new king, another group may have swayed them before their arrival in Venice. To openly break with Emperor Sigismund V, however, could very well provoke a crisis of its own. In light of all this, when Poland made their remarks in Venice…"
  dvg_hungary.26.a: "They surprised everyone by siding with Scandinavia and Hungary."
  dvg_hungary.26.b: "They surprised no one by continuing their support for the Empire."

  dvg_hungary.27.t: "The Austrian Speech"
  dvg_hungary.27.d: "The very presence of a Danubian delegation at the Congress turned heads in Venice. As one of the few members of the Holy Roman Empire with the clout to challenge the Emperor, and given their representation of the minor Imperial princes as a whole, they had to choose their words carefully to uphold their reputation."
  dvg_hungary.27.f: "In the runup to the Congress, most of their ministers felt that they should conditionally support the Emperor in exchange for mediation regarding Transleithania. This region of the Hungarian borderland has been settled by Germans from across the Empire, but particularly from Austria. Thus they could offer to support the Jagiellon's claim to the Hungarian throne if they promise to award Transleithania to them. This would of course anger Scandinavia, whose rhetoric has revolved around preserving Hungarian independence. It would also considerably empower the Jagiellons, which will make challenging them in the future even more difficult. With all of this in mind, upon arrival at the Congress, their delegation…"
  dvg_hungary.27.a: "Came out in opposition to Imperial rule over Hungary."
  dvg_hungary.27.b: "Supported the Emperor on the condition of territorial mediation."

  dvg_hungary.28.t: "The Anglois Speech"
  dvg_hungary.28.d: "No country at the Congress of Venice commanded as much authority or influence as the United Kingdom of England and France. They were the leading architects of the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris], and in Venice it fell to them to once again guide the fate of Europe."
  dvg_hungary.28.f: "There had been fierce debate amongst their ministers on whether to back the Jagiellonian claim to the Hungarian throne. It is true that a Jagiellon Hungary would be a nightmare for Scandinavia and Burgundy, their two greatest rivals. Yet the memories of the Great German War, of mad revolutionary Marinus Dahlke and despotic Holy Roman Emperor Wenceslaus V's attempts to centralize the Empire into one titanic realm, are fresh in their minds. The Crown of St. Stephen could be the first step in an Imperial revival - they should not grant it lightly. Thus, when the time came for their delegation to speak…"
  dvg_hungary.28.a: "They stressed the need to uphold the status quo."
  dvg_hungary.28.b: "They declared that the Jagiellons are the rightful rulers of Hungary."

  dvg_hungary.29.t: "The Congress of Venice Adjourns"
  dvg_hungary.29.d: "Scribes had been hard at work in the previous weeks consigning all major speeches given by the diplomats in the Sala di Maggior Consiglio while talks continued throughout the palaces and the rooms where each delegation was hosted. For many the matter of Hungary was soon to be concluded with all major parties having made their opinion known."
  dvg_hungary.29.f: "However, Karl von Schwarzenberg decided to put the Mecklenburg question at the center of the Congress : for if powers were interested in the rights of Hungary, why should they not listen as well to the plight of Mecklenburg, whose people asked for deliverance since the famous Schwerin demonstration of 1838. Following this change of plans, most diplomats have headed back to their countries to make the intentions of their princes and governments known and avoid another diplomatic incident."
  dvg_hungary.29.a: "More talks and leisure in Venice, truly interesting times!"
 
  dvg_hungary.30.t: "The Pomerania Plan"
  dvg_hungary.30.d: "In the aftermath of the Congress of Venice, tensions between pro-Scandinavian and pro-Imperial factions are brewing in northern Germany. Now, some of our more pragmatic ministers have proposed to secretly strike a deal with Emperor Sigismund V."
  dvg_hungary.30.f: "We may be able to convince him to reaffirm his dynasty's forfeiture of the Hungarian crown - and a guarantee of our influence in the Rhine basin - in exchange for Scandinavian Pomerania. The Jagiellons are currently seeking to use the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz's claim to the Duchy of Mecklenburg as a stepping stone to claiming all of Scandinavian Germany. It is likely that Sigismund could be persuaded to give up on Hungary in order to acquire it. However, this would mean betraying Scandinavia, our greatest ally, to say nothing of how it might enable the Jagiellons to consolidate dangerous levels of power amongst the Germans. Still, it would avert any chance of either the Pomeranian or Hungarian issues drawing Europe into a greater crisis."
  dvg_hungary.30.a: "Reichstadt is nice this time of year, perfect for a meeting."
  dvg_hungary.30.b: "No, we will not throw Scandinavia to the wolves."

  dvg_hungary.31.t: "A Reichstadt Convention?"
  dvg_hungary.31.d: "The Burgundian ambassador has secretly met with our foreign minister in Reichstadt to present an unusual offer. Anvers have noted with alarm the growing tensions in Pomerania over the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz's claims, and has proposed a secret treaty that would pledge their support to the Imperial reclamation of the Baltic coast in exchange for two things: our complete disavowal of the Hungarian crown, and a guarantee of Burgundian influence in the Rhenish and Westphalian Circles (northwestern Germany)."
  dvg_hungary.31.f: "This is a rather shocking act, given the historic Burgundian-Scandinavian alliance, but the liberation of Pomerania would likely prove of greater value to our efforts to consolidate Germany compared to the Hungarian crown. Of course, it would also give Burgundy a chance to make inroads into both Hungary and Germany, and we could always seek to claim Hungary now and regain Pomerania in the future…The final choice is in the hands of the Emperor."
  dvg_hungary.31.a: "We find these conditions acceptable, sign the Reichstadt Convention."
  dvg_hungary.31.b: "The Crown of Hungary is more valuable than Pomerania."

  dvg_hungary.32.t: "Austria Demands Hungarian Territory"
  dvg_hungary.32.d: "During the Congress of Venice, we were surprised when the Austrian representative largely supported our claim to Hungary. However, at the time they made reference to seeking “territorial mediations,” and now they have made plain their meaning."
  dvg_hungary.32.f: "In exchange for supporting Emperor Sigismund V's candidacy for the Hungarian crown, Austria desires to annex Transleithania, the western Hungarian border region long settled by various waves of Danubian colonists and immigrants, many descended from Austrians. Most of our ministers find this demand impudent and above their station, but we should remember that Austria has been chosen to represent the minor German princes of the Holy Roman Empire at large.#R Rebuking them could allow them to turn the rest of the Empire against us and end any chance of claiming Hungary. #!"
  dvg_hungary.32.a: "They think too highly of themselves."
  dvg_hungary.32.b: "A small price to pay."

  dvg_hungary.33.t: "Austrian Denouncement"
  dvg_hungary.33.d: "Austrian foreign minister Rudolph von Polz, head of his delegation, issued a withering condemnation of Emperor Sigismund V this morning over his “trampling of the rights and privileges of the Imperial Estates in pursuit of the Crown of St. Stephen.”"
  dvg_hungary.33.f: "He portrayed the Emperor as attempting to circumvent the entire structure of the Holy Roman Empire and permanently tip the balance of internal politics in the Jagiellons' favor, and concluded by announcing the immediate withdrawal of Austria from the Congress. News of this is already spreading across the Empire. Many minor German princes are now questioning the implications of what a Jagiellon Hungary would mean for the Empire at large, and they are not comforted by their answers. A tide of opposition to Sigismund's acquisition of Hungary is rapidly building and the Magyars may now lie beyond our reach."
  dvg_hungary.33.a: "Damn it all!"
  dvg_hungary.33.b: "Interesting..."

  dvg_hungary.34.t: "Start of the Second Congress of Venice"
  dvg_hungary.34.d: "The Congress reconvenes and it has lost its novelty: most Venetians did not bother to come and greet the delegations at the Piazza San Marco, and in truth the fireworks and banquets offered by the Republic were far less generous than during the first opening."
  dvg_hungary.34.f: "For many patricians it also means more expenses, and some delegations have already been relocated elsewhere in the city because of some bad memories of their stay. Nonetheless, the Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who has decided to come plea for himself, has been the focus of all gossips. Many journalists describing this tall and courteous man as “the best representative of the Teutonic stock this land has seen since Barbarossa”. Now after a new common mass in the Basilicate, the delegates have walked again towards the Ducal Palace to hear the new speeches and hopefully settle the matter of both Hungary and Mecklenburg-Pomerania peacefully."
  dvg_hungary.34.a: "Europe is counting on us!"

  dvg_hungary.35.t: "The Degrelle-von Schwartzenberg Pact"
  dvg_hungary.35.d: "The Second Congress of Venice was supposed to begin today, with delegations returning to the Serenissima's capital to address the issue of Pomerania. However, shortly after proceedings were opened, Burgundian foreign minister Maxime Degrelle and Imperial foreign minister Karl von Schwartzenberg made a pair of speeches in which they announced an “agreement” on the “Pomeranian question” had been reached."
  dvg_hungary.35.f: "The whole assembly was stunned to learn that Emperor Sigismund V was willing to completely disavow Hungary on the condition of Scandinavia immediately ceding Pomerania to the Empire - and that Burgundy supported this arrangement! The chamber descended into pandemonium, with the Scandinavian delegation outraged, and the Anglois delegation similarly furious. It seems Burgundy wanted a free Hungary more than a Nordic alliance. The day ended with most delegates abandoning the Congress, and all eyes are now on Scandinavia to see if they will abide by this Faustian bargain between their greatest rival and their once-greatest ally."
  dvg_hungary.35.a: "Unto that Power he doth belong Which only doeth Right while ever willing Wrong."

  dvg_hungary.36.t: "The Burgundian Backstab"
  dvg_hungary.36.d: "The unthinkable has happened. Burgundy - whether to “ensure Hungarian independence,” as they have publicly stated, or for some perverse reason known only to themselves - has sided with Sigismund V and demanded that we cede Pomerania to the Holy Roman Empire."
  dvg_hungary.36.f: "The enormity of this betrayal by our ancient ally, the only other great Protestant power in Europe, cannot be understated, but at present we must address the grim reality of the situation. If we surrender Pomerania then all hope of advancing further into northern Germany or consolidating the Baltic coast may be dashed, and the integrity of our realm imperiled - if nothing else then it would certainly be the death knell of the Unionster Party's popularity. If we refuse, then we will have to face the Holy Roman Empire and its allies without anyone else by our side. Regardless of our choice, Scandinavia now faces its darkest hour."
  dvg_hungary.36.a: "#B Si vis pacem… (Cede Mecklenburg and Pomerania) #!"
  dvg_hungary.36.b: "#R …para bellum. (MECKLENBURG WAR IMMINENT) #!"

  dvg_hungary.37.t: "Scandinavia Cedes Pomerania"
  dvg_hungary.37.d: "It had been rumored that Scandinavia was planning to withdraw from the Congress and refuse to recognize its results should it have created any treaty that would have forced them to cede their German lands. However the support of Burgundy for our cause compelled them to realize the futility of such an action."
  dvg_hungary.37.f: "Therefore they have returned Mecklenburg and Pomerania to Imperial control, evacuating all civil and military personnel from the region. We are amused to learn that this had caused a political crisis within Scandinavia, but right now we must focus upon reintegrating the long-estranged eastern German coast."
  dvg_hungary.37.a: "Welcome home, men and women of the Empire!"

  dvg_hungary.38.t: "Scandinavia Defies Us!"
  dvg_hungary.38.d: "Despite Burgundy's support for the restoration of Imperial lands occupied by Scandinavia, the perfidious Nordics refused to see reason. They have asserted that their rule over the eastern German coast is “unquestionable,” and have in essence dared us to enforce our demands by force!"
  dvg_hungary.38.f: "We now have a choice to make. We would be perfectly within our rights to declare a Reichskrieg against Scandinavia and rally the Imperial Estates to the liberation of the north. Yet to use diplomatic means to ensure that the rest of the great powers officially denounce Scandinavia and recognize the Empire's right to the north would go a long way towards rebuilding our reputation…while still leaving the door upon to punish Scandinavia in the future at a moment of our choosing."
  dvg_hungary.38.a: "At last, a war where all of Europe recognizes that WE are in the right!"
  dvg_hungary.38.b: "Let them be made true criminals by the consent of Europe first."

  dvg_hungary.39.t: "The Mecklenburg War"
  dvg_hungary.39.d: "“It is harsh in the world, whoredom rife - an axe age, a sword age - shields are riven - a wind age, a wolf age - before the world goes headlong. No man will have mercy on another.” - The Völuspá, as recorded in the Poetic Edda, Volume II"
  dvg_hungary.39.f: "Since the days of the Norse, Scandinavian powers have sought control over the Baltic. That conflict has now once more led Scandinavia into conflict with Bohemia, long the protector of the Germans and recently recovering its strength. While the spark of this conflict sprung from failed negotiations in Venice, it is rooted in the struggle for dominance of northern Germany between the two powers. Only total victory will save Scandinavia's position amongst the Elbian Germans. Anything less will end their authority in the region and confirm the Empire's rule in the north. This war shall be the Twilight of the Gods - but which gods? Those in Copenhagen, or those in Prague?"
  dvg_hungary.39.a: "For Konge og Land!"

  dvg_hungary.40.t: "The Treaty of Prague"
  dvg_hungary.40.d: "Fortune has not favored Scandinavia. Bohemia has driven us out of Germany in its entirety and we have been unable to reclaim our lands, forcing us to sue for peace."
  dvg_hungary.40.f: "The resulting treaty has stripped us of all German-speaking lands east of Holstein. The Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz has merged his crown with that of old Pomerania into a united duchy with the Emperor's blessing, and Bohemia has proven her credentials as the standard bearer of German leadership. The announcement of this treaty has provoked apocalyptic fury across Scandinavian society towards the Unionster government. Many are calling not merely for the administration's resignation, but for its overthrow, in the face of this unmitigated disaster. The military is particularly irate at our failure and blames political interference from the civilian leadership for “stabbing Scandinavia in the back.” Liberal or reactionary revolution could come at any moment and any possibility of advancing Scandinavian rule over Germany has been irrevocably lost."
  dvg_hungary.40.a: "God help us all."

  dvg_hungary.41.t: "Victory in the Mecklenburg War!"
  dvg_hungary.41.d: "At last, the injustices of the early 17th century have been undone, and the northern frontier of the Empire has been liberated. As a sign of generosity, Emperor Sigismund V has not seized the area for himself, but has instead crowned Duke Erwin III von Mecklenburg-Strelitz as the Duke of Pomerania, allowing him to merge his old title into his new one."
  dvg_hungary.41.f: "The House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz shall no doubt be quite grateful for this service and will dutifully rule the region in our stead until the Empire can be fully reconsolidated. Most of all we have proven our merit as the defender of the German people and shown the world that the Empire remains a force to be reckoned with."
  dvg_hungary.41.a: "Let the Imperial eagle soar!"

  dvg_hungary.42.t: "Victory in the Mecklenburg War!"
  dvg_hungary.42.d: "Once again, the Jagiellons have failed to steal Pomerania from its rightful overlords. Pro-Imperial partisans are being rooted out across our German territories and the Great Powers have been forced to restore their recognition of our legitimate rule in the region."
  dvg_hungary.42.f: "We should not rest upon our laurels - this has not solved the issue of German nationalism within our realm forever - but for the short term we have foiled any attempt by the Emperor to lay claim to our lands. Most of all we have proven that the Empire has grown weak, and that the future of Germany is up for grabs."
  dvg_hungary.42.a: "Let the Scandinavian lion roar!"

  dvg_hungary.43.t: "The Treaty of Copenhagen"
  dvg_hungary.43.d: "Fortune has not favored the Jagiellons. Scandinavia has shattered our offensive and thwarted all attempts to advance into Mecklenburg, forcing us to sue for peace."
  dvg_hungary.43.f: "The resulting treaty has reaffirmed their rule over the north. The Stuarts have compelled the international community to once more recognize their ownership of Mecklenburg and Pomerania, ending any chance of restoring the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz there. The announcement of this treaty has provoked apocalyptic fury amongst our subjects towards the Emperor and his court. Many are calling not merely for the current administration’s resignation, but for its overthrow, in the face of this unmitigated disaster. The military is particularly irate at our failure and blames political interference from the civilian leadership for “stabbing the Empire in the back.” Liberal or reactionary revolution could come at any moment and the rebirth of the Empire has suffered a dire setback."

  dvg_hungary.50.d: "“The House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, scions of a venerable line, has since time immemorial ruled the duchy which bears the name of their noble dynasty, but as of late this rightful land has been usurped from them. The Arch-Kingdom of Scandinavia has transgressed upon the ancient domains of Mecklenburg, reducing this once-proud member of the German Empire to the last sliver of their realm.”"
  dvg_hungary.50.f: "“For as long as the Duchy of Mecklenburg remains under the unlawful occupation of the Scandinavian Crown, the German Empire shall be bereft of both its integrity and its security. Shall we leave the heart of Europe stranded upon the rocks of discord for the sake of Scandinavian imperial vainglory? Restitution is the only acceptable answer. The Duchy of Mecklenburg must be restored in full, and to its complete natural size with the venerable Duke Adolf V as their leader…”"
  dvg_hungary.50.a: "Obviously!"
  dvg_hungary.50.b: "Interesting..."

  dvg_hungary.51.t: "The Imperial Speech"
  dvg_hungary.51.d: "Karl von Schwarzenberg, foreign minister of the Holy Roman Empire, was the first delegate to speak at the Second Congress of Venice. He made a long-winded address in which he discussed the House of Mecklenburg, an old but minor noble dynasty of northeastern Germany, and its claim on western Pomerania."
  dvg_hungary.51.f: " His argument for the return of the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz's lands to Imperial control soon spiralled into a complicated attempt to advocate for the Empire to take control of all of Scandinavian Pomerania. Some delegates were totally confused by his rhetoric, but most dismissed it as Jagiellon saber-rattling and a melodramatic effort to use a minor prince's grievances as a weapon against their Nordic rival. It is hardly the first time that Scandinavia and the Empire have sparred, even verbally, over Pomerania."
  dvg_hungary.51.a: "Obviously!"
  dvg_hungary.51.b: "Really? This again?"
  
  dvg_hungary.52.t: "The Scandinavian Speech"
  dvg_hungary.52.d: "“The CRIMINAL EMPEROR in Prague,” roared Dag Mikkelsen, Scandinavian foreign minister, “would have this honored assembly believe that the Treaty of Paris and all of its provisions were nothing but a scrap of paper, to be thrown out with the evening refuse.”"
  dvg_hungary.52.f: "“Not content to seek the Kingdom of Hungary and, through the basest deception imaginable, exploit her moment of weakness to clamp the Crown of Saint Stephen down upon his head, he now schemes - yes, SCHEMES, gentlemen! - to advance a spurious agenda against the Scandinavian realm. His honorable representative speaks of the House of Mecklenburg, but when did that house rule over all of Pomerania? And if, gentlemen, we were to accept his argument, what then would be the result? Shall we see the borders of Europe completely overturned, day after day, at the whims of any petty noble? Our nations, including the German Empire, signed the Treaty of Paris for a reason. Dispense with that reasoning, and we shall dispense with the very notion of law…”"

  dvg_hungary.53.f: "“Those notions were precisely the fallacious and barbarous errors which the Treaty of Paris was drafted, signed, and ratified to defend against. The representatives of all the great and ancient states of Europe affixed their signatures to that document with the intention of exorcising the scourge of cyclical animosity from this continent forever. Let us not resurrect that foul shade, and by doing so render all the efforts of this generation, for naught. To cast down the Treaty, not by accident or fell circumstance, but by concerted effort, would augur ill for any hope of understanding between the nations going forward…”"

  dvg_hungary.54.d: "Unlike the previous Congress, support for the Jagiellon position regarding Pomerania amongst the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's delegation was far from unanimous."
  dvg_hungary.54.f: "While many delegates were eager to weaken Scandinavia and reduce their presence in the Baltic, many others were cognizant of just how much more powerful the Empire would become by regaining Pomerania. There was also a third, more neutral group, who saw the question as irrelevant to the Commonwealth itself, unlike the Hungarian Question. These divisions mostly reflected the positions of the pro-Imperial, pro-Scandinavian, and pro-Hungarian candidates of the last Sejm. Thus it seemed logical that whichever candidate had prevailed would use his influence as king, however limited, to tilt the balance in his favor. For that reason, the Polish-Lithuanian delegation ultimately…"
  dvg_hungary.54.a: "Supported the status quo and upholding the Treaty of Paris."
  dvg_hungary.54.b: "Sided with the Jagiellons and the Empire."

  dvg_hungary.55.t: "The Ottoman Speech"
  dvg_hungary.55.d: "The Ottoman delegation at the Second Congress of Venice was notably relaxed compared to the one which had attended the first. Pomerania was of little relevance to the Sublime Ottoman State, and the matter was seen strictly through the lens of opposing their old rivals in Prague."
  dvg_hungary.55.f: "Thus it was felt that they could side with Scandinavia without such a position being seen as a direct attack against the Jagiellons, but rather as a commitment to upholding the Treaty of Paris. However, there was also a somewhat renegade minority amongst the delegation, who latched on to the theory (favored by some Burgundian delegates as well) that by strengthening the Jagiellon's commitments in the Empire proper, they would be dissuaded from Balkan adventurism. Therefore some Turkish delegates advocated for the Imperial claim to Pomerania solely to redirect its attention from Hungary. In the end, the position which won out was…"
  dvg_hungary.55.a: "The anti-Imperial majority's defense of the Treaty of Paris."
  dvg_hungary.55.b: "The pro-Imperial minority's pragmatic support of the Jagiellons."

  dvg_hungary.56.t: "The Austrian Speech"
  dvg_hungary.56.d: "The Second Congress of Venice was puzzled by the Austrians' vague remarks. This vagueness was due to the fact that, at the time, the Austrians were in heated private negotiations with the Imperial delegates over internal Danubian politics."
  dvg_hungary.56.f: "Austrian foreign minister Rudolph von Polzl had been instructed to pressure the Jagiellons to adopt a policy of supporting Austria in all “regional disputes” going forward. This was a clear reference to the Electorate of Bavaria, who had emerged as Austria's rival for Danubian dominance. If Imperial foreign minister Karl von Schwarzenberg refused this request - which was more akin to a demand - then the Austrians were prepared to denounce the Jagiellons in public. Given Austria's role as representative of the minor Imperial princes at large, this would almost certainly ruin any hope of the Emperor gaining internal support for the House of Mecklenburg and thus Pomerania's return. Of course, some delegates saw negotiation as useless and urged support for Scandinavia solely to weaken the Jagiellons."
  dvg_hungary.56.a: "Cut off negotiations, we utterly refuse to aid Jagiellon expansion."
  dvg_hungary.56.b: "Keep pressing the Emperor's men for a deal."

  dvg_hungary.57.t: "The Austrians Make an 'Offer'"
  dvg_hungary.57.d: "The arrogance of the Archduchy of Austria continues to know no bounds. After having demanded Transleithania in exchange for their support during the last Congress, they have now once again approached our representatives in private with more imperious desires."
  dvg_hungary.57.f: "This time they want a commitment from the Emperor that Austria will be supported over Bavaria in any further regional disputes between the two powers! Their excuse is that this would improve Imperial stability and act as a check on Bavarian expansionism. While the nature of such an agreement would keep us from being obligated to commit to it, the consequences for our reputation amongst the German princes of going back on our word could be dire. At the same time, Imperial patronage could allow Austria to accumulate a dangerous level of influence in the region.#R If we want to secure the German princes' backing for the Imperial claim on Pomerania, however, then we have no other choice. #!"
  dvg_hungary.57.a: "The Austrians forget their place!"
  dvg_hungary.57.b: "A necessary sacrifice for the sake of the Jagiellon dynasty."

  dvg_hungary.58.t: "Austrian Delegates Denounce the Emperor"
  dvg_hungary.58.d: "The Imperial representatives terminated negotiations last night, going so far as to accuse us (and implicitly, our Archduke) of insubordination."
  dvg_hungary.58.f: "Thus, foreign minister von Polzl issued a withering condemnation of Emperor Sigismund V this morning over his “shameless exploitation of the Imperial Estates in pursuit of blatant adventurism.” He castigated the Emperor for using the grievances of the House of Mecklenburg as a weapon both against Scandinavia and to increase his own dynasty's power, which could permanently tip the balance of internal politics in the Jagiellons favor. Von Polzl concluded by announcing the immediate withdrawal of Austria from the Congress. News of this is already spreading across the Holy Roman Empire. Many minor German princes are now questioning the true intentions of the Emperor in this dispute with the Nordics, and they are not comforted by their answers. A tide of opposition to Sigismund's Pomeranian gambit is rapidly building and we may have destroyed his efforts to claim it."
  dvg_hungary.58.a: "You are terminated!"

  dvg_hungary.60.t: "The Anglois Speech"
  dvg_hungary.60.d: "Once again, it falls to the United Kingdom of England and France to have the last word amongst the nations of Europe. The Holy Roman Empire and Scandinavia have both made their cases for control of Pomerania. We are the only great power in Europe which the Empire could call its ally, even if that “alliance” has more often been simply our common interests of defending Catholicism and keeping Burgundy, Scandinavia, and the Turks in check."
  dvg_hungary.60.f: "Yet by aiding the Empire, we would be scorning the Treaty of Paris and emerging notions of international law. There is also the fact that Emperor Sigismund V has made no secret of his aims to continue his father Wenceslaus V's efforts to consolidate the Empire back into a single realm, which could allow the Jagiellons to control the fate of Europe. Scandinavia has long been one of the twin shepherds of Protestantism alongside Burgundy, and a great thorn in our side, but we must ask ourselves: is weakening the Stuarts worth opening the door to a centralized Holy Roman Empire?"
  dvg_hungary.60.a: "Only Pomerania's return will guarantee peace in Europe."

  dvg_hungary.61.f: "The Congress of Venice has chosen to restore Mecklenburg and Pomerania to the Empire.

  dvg_hungary.62.f: "The Congress of Venice has chosen to reaffirm the existing border between Scandinavia and the Holy Roman Empire in regards to Pomerania.” No territorial changes have been made and all attempts to restore Imperial control over Pomerania have failed.
