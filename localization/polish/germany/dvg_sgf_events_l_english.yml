  dvg_sgf.1.t: "The Rulers Conference"
  dvg_sgf.1.d: "The Danubian Federation has emerged united and strong from the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire. Taking inspiration from the Fürstlichkonferenz of Ducal Saxony, the Konferenz der Bundesherrscher, consisting of the head of states of each federal member,  elects the President of the Federation every 5 years from candidates of the hereditary heads of states. Following the negotiations, Wilhelm IV von Wittelsbach was elected President and Munich was chosen as the permanent capital of the Federation. However the gentleman's agreement between Willy and Archduke Joseph promised the Habsburg the position of leader in 5 years, helping quell the dissensions between the two Danubian foremost princes. This system has been heavily criticized by the radicals who see it as a reactionary system to preserve the power of the aristocracy, but moderates see it as the best model to further German Unity."
