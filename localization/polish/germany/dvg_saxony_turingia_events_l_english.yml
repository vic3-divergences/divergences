  dvg_saxony.2.d: "After the Great German War and the subsequent peace treaties, the Ernestine duchies signed the Erfurt Agreement of 2823. This prevented further partitioning and laid clear guidelines for the division of land should a ducal line be extinguished. However, all lines survived and the agreement was revised. This new agreement created the 'confederation' of Ducal Saxony. All duchies are sovereign but their laws and taxes are synchronized, a central government was set up to administer the whole region, and a new unitary flag was created for the state. Saxe-Meiningen-Eisenach was excluded from several clauses of the Erfurt Agreement due to perceived exceptionalism and its special tax rights. Now that its economy has stagnated, it wants to join. With the Ernestine duchies now fully reunited, the dukes intend to reorganize the confederation under the banner of the old Duchy of Thuringia whose partitioning created the duchies in the first place. However the Emperor may force us to accept his personal “protection” in exchange for approving this."
