  dvg_austria.1.t: "The Archduchy of Austria"
  dvg_austria.1.d: "Many Austrians believe that their archduchy has been dealt a terrible hand in recent history: Siding with the losing factions during the Great German War three times and surrendering to their political archnemesis Bavaria and Bohemia during the Congress of Paris in 1820, Austria has been dismantled to its crownlands. The House of Habsburg-Ravensberg is now stuck in an identity crisis: Isolated by geography and diplomacy, its influence upon the other Danubian states is limited, though a large percentage of the population, inspired by Dahlke's victory against the Wittelsbachs, take pride in their perceived German heritage. Nonetheless, a significant minority of Protestant Slovenes and Germans in the Duchy of Carinthia rally around the emerging ideals of self-determination against Catholic Vienna or even Munich in the future. Now, the current Archduke, Joseph II, whose succession was more of an unplanned blunder than an expected outcome, will have to lead Austria out of its current misery, and maybe even to greater heights..."

  dvg_austria.2.t: "News from Klagenfurt"
  dvg_austria.2.d: "The March of Carinthia was formed in 889 by King Carloman of the ancient kingdom of Bavaria, granted to his son Arnulf, and was raised to a duchy in 976. Though the composition of the Empire has shifted massively since then, Carinthia's estrangement from the rest of Germany has not. The lower Carinthian nobility, many of them Protestant Germanized Slovenes, have historically exercised great autonomy. Furthermore, many of Carinthia's larger settlements lie south of the Alps, increasing their separation. The years since the Great German War have seen an embryonic Slovenian nationalism begin to coalesce, and the Landtag has begun to reflect this Slovene ascendancy. Now a printer in Klagenfurt has taken to printing a newspaper in the Slovenian language, the first of its kind and one which may set off a domino chain of Slovenian cultural revivalism.#R If we have not addressed the Carinthian situation before pursuing any form of German unification then this problem may come to a head.#!"

  dvg_austria.3.t: "Trouble in the House of Habsburg"
  dvg_austria.3.d: "Previous Archduke Charles IV's unwillingness to properly govern the archduchy resulted in several revolts against his rule in Rhenish Ravensberg and Carinthia shortly before the Great German War. When Charles IV died, a succession struggle ensued since he left no surviving direct male heirs, though after a bloodless "coup" his only male grandson Joseph II who initially wasn't intended to rule Austria in the first place gained the crown with the support of the savvy Chancellor Erwin-Adalbert of Sigmaringen. Thus, the surviving daughter Maria Leopoldina and two other elder granddaughters Maria Louise and Clementina were completely overlooked, especially Maria Louise who was old enough at the time to properly rule the archduchy. Maria Louise was later married to a Bavarian prince, who now stands to inherit the Duchy because of the lack of offspring of Wilhelm IV while Clementina defied the Vienna Court by marrying Georg Khevenhüller, a prominent Carinthian noble and converted to Protestantism."

  dvg_austria.4.t: "The Dreams of Joseph II"
  dvg_austria.4.d: "Archduke Joseph II watched the unification of Ducal Saxony with considerable interest. It is well known within the royal court that Joseph, like most Austrians, is wary of Bavarian ambitions to claim hegemony over the Germans of the Danube. While some have spoken in baleful terms of a coming apocalyptic struggle between the two powers, Joseph has a different vision in mind. While he agrees that the unification of the Danube is more or less inevitable, he believes that Austria can still preserve her honor and dignity through decentralization. The crux of his ideas lies in the Danubian Circle, the Imperial administrative region encompassing both Austria and Bavaria. These Imperial Circles have been used for centuries to coordinate mutual defense, taxation, and representation in the Reichstag and the Reichskammergericht (Imperial Chamber Court). While they do in theory each have a common legislature, the Circle Diets, they have never been seen as nations in their own right. But they very well could serve as the model for one…"

  dvg_austria.5.d: "Stanislaw von Habsburg, a relative of our own Archduke, has recently been elected king of Poland and thus lord of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth following the death of his father, Maximilian III. Since the middle of the 18th century, a branch of our dynasty has been living in Poland, and the election of Stanislaw confirms the prestige of our esteemed and venerable house. Joseph II was quick to send him his congratulations, and plan for a marriage between the Austrian branch and the Polish one are underway."

  dvg_austria.6.t: "Stanislaw Exiled to Moscow"
  dvg_austria.6.d: "Since the middle of the 18th century, a branch of our dynasty has been living in Poland, its most prominent scion being Stanislaw von Habsburg. Today we learned that Stanislaw has been accused of treason against the Polish crown, and was forced to flee the country! He was put forth as a candidate at a Sejm to elect a new monarch of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth a few years ago, but failed to receive sufficient votes. Now a group of liberal revolutionaries were just recently arrested in Warsaw, and under questioning revealed that they had planned to kill the current king and coronate Stanislaw in his stead. Stanislaw was forced to go into exile in order to escape a trial for high crimes against the Polish Crown. Rather than travel to his dynasty’s homeland, he fled east to the realm of Moscow, possibly to court Russian aid to claim the Polish crown. While many of our relatives do not believe the charges against him, for now he has become a black sheep."

  dvg_austria.7.d: "King Stanislaw of Poland has won a great triumph! We have been following his exploits since his coronation, and he has astounded Europe by rescuing the Commonwealth from destruction more than once during his reign. Fighting off both predatory nobles and foreign attacks, he has revitalized and reunited his realm, ensuring the survival of the Commonwealth for generations to come. The prestige of the House of Habsburg has soared to new heights, and if nothing else then our dynasty shall be remembered as the saviors of the Polish people. Perhaps one day Joseph II will rise to match the fame of his relative - perhaps one day, he too shall bring unity to his people. But for now, let us prepare a feast in Stanislaw's honor!"

  dvg_austria.8.t: "The Downfall of Stanislaw"
  dvg_austria.8.d: "King Stanislaw of Poland recently attempted to execute an ambitious plan to eliminate both the political power of the nobility and the influence of foreign powers like Scandinavia and the Holy Roman Empire. This entailed imposing drastic reforms upon the Commonwealth and plunging the realm into a brutal and destructive war with multiple neighboring powers. It is now clear that Stanislaw's ambitions were larger than his talents. The Commonwealth has suffered a dramatic defeat. Its lands have been partitioned, his reforms undone, and Stanislaw, overwhelmed with grief, has destroyed himself in the most literal sense. His failure is a stain on the House of Habsburg, and none of the peoples once counted within the Commonwealth will ever forgive or forget our dynasty and the role which it played in their downfall."

  dvg_austria.9.t: "Passau Black Market"
  dvg_austria.9.d: "Passau was burned twice in the last century. The city's renovation was paid by the Bavarian duke with the local magnate, Bishop Eberhard II of Passau, effectively laundering the money to use it for the city's reconstruction. Nonetheless, Passau was mediatized to Austria during the Great German War and it is the only gain which we kept in the Treaty of Paris. Yet most of the citizens of Passau would have preferred joining the Bavarian Electorate, where most of their trade is done. While we are keeping an eye on the community, so far actual separatism is not an issue according to the local authorities. What has emerged instead is a thriving underground market where illicit goods change hands, particularly radical liberal and pan-German literature printed in Bavaria."

  dvg_austria.10.t: "The Petition from Klagenfurt"
  dvg_austria.10.d: "Over the last few years, Slovenian nationalism has coalesced behind a push to make the Landtag more reflective of the population and curtail the power of the German (including the Germanized Slovene) nobility. It was hoped that we could circumvent the Carinthian issue through German nationalism. However, the prospect of becoming a minority in a pan-German (and possibly even officially Catholic) state has sent alarm bells ringing throughout Carinthia, and this fear has manifested in the Landtag. Now a group of notable Carinthian Slovene politicians have arrived in the capital to present a request for a conference between Austrian and Carinthian officials to arrive at what they call an Ausgleich, or “Compromise.” It is feared that the Carinthians will demand significant cultural and political protections as a condition for supporting the unification of the Danube, but all things considered this is a rather polite request and refusal could cause Carinthian separatism and Slovenian nationalism to merge."

  dvg_austria.11.t: "The Carinthian War of Independence"
  dvg_austria.11.d: "Our refusal to negotiate with the Carinthian Landtag confirmed the worst fears of Slovenian nationalists. They have become obsessed with the idea that we will reduce them to an internal colony and suppress their cultural and religious identity. A call to action was recently published in the Slovenian newspaper Celovški casi (Klagenfurt Times) by Protestant priest and Slovenian nationalist Father Aleksandar Kozler, and this morning he gave an inflammatory sermon in which he called upon the Slovenes of Carinthia to rise up against “the German Babylon.” The result was a mass mutiny of ethnic Slovenian soldiers in the Carinthian militia, who arrested their own German officers and then converged on the Carinthian capital to swear loyalty to Kozler! He has now been proclaimed the provisional president of a republican regime, and declared full independence from both Austria and the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation."

  dvg_austria.12.t: "The Ausgleich Conference"
  dvg_austria.12.d: "The conference between Austrian and Carinthian politicians, the latter headed by Carinthian politician Peter Miklosich, has been convened. After multiple rounds of heated negotiations, where we were able to convince the Carinthians that independence was off the table, it appears that they want one of two concessions : either autonomy, or the disavowal by Vienna of pan-German projects. The Carinthians have absolutely refused to accept any sort of internal status within a future pan-German state that would not allow their own Landtag to legislate matters within Carinthia. Many of our own politicians believe that these negotiations are a waste of time, though a handful of isolationists have raised the point that a pan-German state could very well subsume the Austrian identity as well. Therefore, they say, the idea of abandoning Danubian unification is not unthinkable. Bavaria would of course be infuriated if we abandon them now for the sake of Carinthia."
