  dvg_bavaria.1.t: "The Electorate of Bavaria"
  dvg_bavaria.1.d: "Bavaria in recent years has become the envy of the various states of the Holy Roman Empire : It remains the only true victor of the Great German Wars, evident by the lack of large-scale destruction of the electorate and its expansion to include the former Princely County of Tyrol in 1814 among other territories, confirmed in the Congress of Paris of 1820."
  dvg_bavaria.1.f: " Guided by two popular dukes in a row, namely Duke Maximilian "Max" IV "the Great" von Wittelsbach, whose exceptionally long reign between 1798 and 1832 was marked by the ascendancy of Bavaria in the Danubian Circle, and his only surviving son William "Willy" IV, who is ruling Bavaria since 1832. Bavaria is still defining its ambitions in Germany and its future is unclear : The impotence of His Serene Highness the Duke-Elector is an open secret, though his young age of only 31 gives him plenty of time to shape the destiny of Bavaria. That is, of course, unless the vast array of political leaders and ideologues which the electorate of Bavaria houses force him into another direction.\n\nThe future lies before us..."

  dvg_bavaria.2.t: "The Constitutional Question"
  dvg_bavaria.2.d: "Munich has become a hub of intellectuals and political refugees from across Germany, but this has in turn emboldened their reactionary enemies, causing political polarization to rise across Bavaria. If we are to survive the rising tide of political turmoil threatening to once again sweep over Europe, then we shall have to renovate our legal system to satisfy the desires of the people. Thus Duke-Elector Wilhelm IV has tasked his jurists and ministers with drafting a new constitution. This will be a slow and careful process as we must consider its implications for the future of our nation.#R Come what may, a royal edict will be proclaimed to enact the constitution around 1843. The more public support which we offer to either parliamentarians or absolutists, the more that their influence will be manifested in the edict. Failure to heed the call of reform could have dire consequences. #!"

  dvg_bavaria.3.t: "Der Karlsbad Tag"
  dvg_bavaria.3.d: "A meeting of Bavarian reactionaries and Great German War veterans has been held in the spa city of Karlsbad, Bohemia. This was no vacation, but rather an informal gathering of noted monarchist and conservative figures from across Bavaria, who felt more comfortable in the Imperial crownlands than in their own, politically polarized country. While no minutes were kept of the meeting, a summary of the conclusions of the “Karlsbad Tag,” which they seek to publish, has been obtained by agents of the crown. This manifesto calls for the suppression of liberalism and German nationalism within Bavaria, equating it to the murderous tyranny of Marinus Dahlke’s Imperial Republic. We have the right to either withhold approval for its distribution, or to demand that the royal censors redact the most indelicate parts, which the liberals would certainly appreciate. Openly siding against so many influential Bavarians, especially men who have shed blood in her name, will of course not enhance the Duke-Elector’s popularity with the nobility."

  dvg_bavaria.4.t: "The Innsbruck Festival"
  dvg_bavaria.4.d: "Inspired by the 1836 Karlsbader Tag, liberals have held their own meeting in Innsbruck under the guise of an “apolitical” county fair which drew thousands of attendees. Many participants were university students or others of similar age, animated by notions of democracy and German nationalism. The former held far greater importance at the Innsbruck assembly, which eventually decided to focus on advocating for the new Bavarian constitution to guarantee a strong, elected Landtag and universal suffrage. The wording of their public statements and proclamations is such that we could arrest their leaders for treason, but doing so might inflame liberal agitation across Bavaria. We could also try to co-opt their more moderate elements and steer them away from republicanism by endorsing the meeting, but this would horrify conservatives. Of course we could always simply place their leaders under police surveillance and publicly ignore the matter."

dvg_bavaria.5.t: "The Trial of 'Das junge Deutschland' Twelve"
  dvg_bavaria.5.d: "Some liberals were angered by the Innsbruck Festival's focus on Bavaria over Germany at large. These radicals formed “Das junge Deutschland,” or “Young Germany,” a political club that has since spread across the Empire. It advocates for a single, revolutionary democratic republic “as far as the German tongue sounds, from Holland to Prussia.” It is unclear if all supposed chapters are in fact part of the same organization, but they are much feared by reactionaries. Recently their loyalists in Bavaria committed several robberies to secure funds, and were then arrested in Regensburg, where plans to overthrow the Bavarian government were found. Now a dozen men - some younger than eighteen - are facing decades of prison time. Most of the defendants had minor roles in the group. Liberals are protesting for their release, alleging that the evidence against them is dubious. Even moderates argue that while a handful of them may be guilty, they do not all deserve such harsh punishments."

dvg_bavaria.6.t: "The Ducal Pamphlet of 1840"
  dvg_bavaria.6.d: "The Ducal Pamphlet is a yearly tradition by which the Duke-Elector of Bavaria can speak directly to his subjects regarding issues of note for the realm. While once a rather symbolic affair, the growth of political turmoil in Bavaria has seen it taken on new emphasis as a window into the minds of the royal court and the administration at large. Years ending in a zero are traditionally broader in scope, reflecting on the past and future rather than addressing recent events or current matters. His Serene Highness the Duke-Elector and his advisors are now drafting the Ducal Pamphlet of 1840, and he is trying to choose a tone for his writing. The safest choice would be a simple appeal to peace and brotherhood, but this could be written off as empty prose. He could also take a more political approach ; either side with the reactionaries, asserting the power of the Crown and recalling the sacrifices of the Great German War, or side with the liberals by promising reform while avoiding specifics."

  dvg_bavaria.7.t: "Street Violence in Munich"
  dvg_bavaria.7.d: "Liberal public meetings, while legal, have increasingly been targeted by reactionaries. In response, reformists began organizing elaborate banquets to cover their gatherings. Now a banquet held at the home of wealthy liberal lawyer Arnold Rapp has sparked something far more dangerous. The banquet attracted an unprecedented number of guests, frightening the chief of the Munich city guard into dispatching policemen to investigate whether it might be a staging ground for a revolt. Residents of Munich awoke in the night to the sounds of street clashes between city guards and liberal students and activists. In the aftermath, legal representatives from both sides - including Rapp himself - are suing one another, and the government is expected to take action. The military has urged the Duke-Elector to suspend freedom of assembly, Rapp has implied that he would urge his colleagues to drop their cases if negotiations with the Crown and the police were arranged, and many liberals have called for more restrictions on the Munich city guard."

  dvg_bavaria.9.t: "Religion in Bavaria"
  dvg_bavaria.9.d: "Bavaria weathered the Protestant Reformation without any new sect taking hold in the realm over the long term. While once regarded as a shining beacon of the Catholic faith in Germany, the recent influx of political refugees, the growth of liberalism, and the rise of Reform Judaism bringing more Jewish Bavarians into the political sphere has called the legal place of the Church within the Electorate into question. Conservatives are adamant that Catholicism is so fundamental to our identity that it must be preserved. Liberals take the opposite view, arguing that it is precisely this devotion to religious dogma which is holding Bavaria back from progress and prosperity. Pan-German nationalists in particular, who see Ashkenazi Jews as fellow Germans and denounce reactionary anti-Semitism, are troubled by the thought of a Bavarian-led Germany with a state religion. If we are to set the state on a sound legal footing then we must adopt a definitive attitude towards religion - one that may be the foundation for nations yet to be born."

At the same time, German nationalism has now reached a fever pitch amongst the people of the Empire, threatening to plunge us all into anarchy. To address both crises, Duke-Elector Wilhelm IV has invited all of the princes and bishops of the Empire to meet at the Royal Opera House in Munich and discuss the future of Germany. The goal of the council will be to determine how the Imperial Estates themselves, rather than the Empire or revolutionaries, can build a new system for Germany given the clear dysfunction of the present one. Our priority is to convince Austria, our old rival, to put aside ancient grudges and unite the Danubian Circle, the Imperial administrative region comprising our two states, into one country. If a smaller union state can survive, then we could expand the model to encompass all of Germany."

While broader points such as tariffs and border controls were discussed, the main conclusion was that the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation had failed to protect the Imperial Estates from threats both foreign and domestic. This signaled the greatest lack of confidence in the Emperor by the Imperial Princes since the Wars of Religion, and that pan-German nationalism had become entrenched among even the upper classes.

Many Salzburg inhabitants would prefer the end of Church rule. The Archbishop was recently forced to sequester himself in the Hohensalzburg fortress after a popular revolt denounced the lack of participation of the Elector in the German Council in Munich, alongside heavy taxes and other grievances. However, the Bavarian cabinet believes that this is a plot by Austria to gain the valleys of the Salzach and a better hand for future negotiations. Duke-Elector Wilhelm IV himself is apprehensive.
