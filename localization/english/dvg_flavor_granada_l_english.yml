 dvg_granada.1.t:0 "The Colombian Independence War and the Viceroyalty of New Granada"
 dvg_granada.1.d:0 "Treachery!"
 dvg_granada.1.f:0 "The Independence of New Toledo has sent ripples throughout Arcadia and Ameriga, and these ripples have finally reached Mexico City. This so-called Colombian Alliance wants independence from the Spanish Crown and has been granted support from their New Toledo peers, leaving New Granada as the sole remaining loyal Viceroyalty in the New World. We must drive back these upstarts and restore the Crown's control over New Spain, lest the revolutionary fervor spreads to our Viceroyalty as well."
 dvg_granada.1.a:0 "For New Granada! For Spain!"
 dvg_granada.2.t:0 "The Colombian Alliance is Defeated"
 dvg_granada.2.d:0 "The revolt in New Spain has been quelled, and the Crown's sovereignity over Mesoameriga is secured."
 dvg_granada.2.f:0 "Victory! In the ruined countryside and cities of New Spain, the might of the Spanish has never been seen more than now. The Alliance loyalists have been routed and Mexico City once again belongs to the Spanish Viceroy. It will take some time before cities and villages of New Spain are restored to their former glory, but now it's clear that Spain is there to stay, and we shall stand with them as we always did."
 dvg_granada.2.a:0 "We stand with Spain!"
 dvg_granada.3.t:0 "The Colombian Independence"
 dvg_granada.3.d:0 "We have failed. The Viceroyalty of New Spain is no more."
 dvg_granada.3.f:0 "The Colombian Independence War is over, and the Spanish forces retreat back to New Granada. Despite our loyalty to the Crown, the Colombian revolt has inspired many people within New Granada, and these voices have only grown louder with the Colombian Alliance's success. New movements are taking form, with the republicans and royalists alike asking for self-governance and independence from Madrid. The time to act is now, lest we too are embroiled in a fratricidal war."
 dvg_granada.3.a:0 "We shall join the Colombians and drive out the Spanish forevermore."
 dvg_granada.3.b:0 "We shall stand loyal to Spain in exchange for greater autonomy. At least for now."
 dvg_granada.4.t:0 "The Truce of 1838"
 dvg_granada.4.d:0 "Stalemate. The Colombian Alliance has seceded, but New Granada is secure."
 dvg_granada.4.f:0 "The Colombian Independence War is over, and the Spanish forces retreat back to New Granada. Despite our loyalty to the Crown, the Colombian revolt has inspired many people within New Granada, and these voices have only grown louder with the Colombian Alliance's success. New movements are taking form, with the republicans and royalists alike asking for self-governance and independence from Madrid. The time to act is now, lest we too are embroiled in a fratricidal war."
 dvg_granada.4.a:0 "We shall stand loyal to Spain in exchange for greater autonomy. At least for now."
 dvg_granada.5.t:0 "The Herrera Revolution"
 dvg_granada.5.d:0 "Treason! General de Blanco has proclaimed the Republic of Herreria and seceded from Granada!"
 dvg_granada.5.f:0 "With the acquisition of Medellin, de Blanco is now prepared to fully contest Spanish rule of New Granada. In a speech delivered from Viceroy Rocafuerte's former mansion, de Blanco has declared himself the “Great Liberator” of a new revolutionary nation, the Republic of Herreria! The insurrectionary state is named after infamous New Granadan revolutionary José de Herrera, who fought both the Incans and the Spanish crown before being killed by Washkar Inca. It seems that de Blanco thinks himself a second de Herrera, and with much of western New Granada now aligned towards him, he might just be able to back up his claims. As northern Ameriga plunges back into the inferno, we must once again prepare for a bitter struggle in the New World."
 dvg_granada.5.a:0 "Revolution is a malaise of New World minds..."
 dvg_granada.5.b:0 "The freedom of the New World is the hope of the universe! (Play as Herreria)"
 dvg_granada.5.c:0 "Enjoy your so-called revolutionary state, madman."
 dvg_granada.5.e:0 "Long live Herreria! Long live de Blanco! (Play as Herreria)"
 dvg_granada.6.t:0 "The Dream is Dead"
 dvg_granada.6.d:0 "The warlords of Granada carve out their domains and the dream of united Granada is no more."
 dvg_granada.6.f:0 "With de Blanco's revolutionaries firmly in control of Herreria, Antonio Rocafuerte makes his move and proclaims the Kingdom of Aureliana in Caracas, followed by Guianan separatists in Essequibo. Where once New Granada stood, three new powers have emerged, each with different views on the fate of what was once the Viceroyalty. Despite their best efforts to drive out the Spanish, they could not save the dream of united Granada."
 dvg_granada.6.a:0 "The end of an era, or merely the start of one? (Play as Aureliana)"
 dvg_granada.6.b:0 "At least we may celebrate this victory. (Play as Essequibo)"
 dvg_granada.7.t:0 "The Raid on the Caracas Armory"
 dvg_granada.7.d:0 "De Blanco's revolutionaries strike at Caracas!"
 dvg_granada.7.f:0 "We thought that the end of the struggle with Colombia would inaugurate a new era of stability in the rest of our empire, but this seems to have been too optimistic. This morning, word reached the royal court that the Spanish Army’s Caracas armory was looted by the guerilla forces of notorious revolutionary Guillermo de Blanco! Apparently, Ramon Salgar, a llanero (cowboy) warlord who is de Blanco’s right-hand man and a native of Aureliana, used a little-known mountain path to bypass the local patrols, then assaulted the town shortly after midnight. His feared Legion of Hell overpowered the initial defenses and headed straight for the armory, blowing open the doors and grabbing all the arms and ammunition that they could carry. As they absconded back into the wilderness, they shouted horrid curses towards the Spanish crown, and cried, “Viva Salgar! Viva de Blanco!” De Blanco’s traitors are now quite well-armed."
 dvg_granada.7.a:0 "Bring me the head of Guillermo de Blanco!"
 dvg_granada.8.t:0 "Raids in Cartagena Countryside"
 dvg_granada.8.d:0 "De Blanco's revolutionaries strike at Cartagena!"
 dvg_granada.8.f:0 "De Blanco wasted no time in putting his ill-gotten gains to use. He has returned to a more confrontational posture, launching coordinated assaults upon loyalist communities throughout the greater Cartagena region. Guerillas have attacked villages across the area, pilfering everything from crops and livestock to tools and medicine. Any town which does not sufficiently “support” de Blanco’s cause is a potential target. As the guerillas wage their most ambitious campaign of violence yet, de Blanco is slowly but surely approaching Medellin, local administrative center of New Granada. If Medellin falls, the whole Spanish colonial government may be imperiled."
 dvg_granada.8.a:0 "Medellin must not fall!"
 dvg_granada.9.t:0 "Essequibo Declares Independence!"
 dvg_granada.9.d:0 "New Granada's eastern flank, Essequibo has proclaimed independence!"
 dvg_granada.9.f:0 "As New Granada plunges into civil war, the Guianan separatists in the east have taken the opportunity to proclaim their own state, the Republic of Essequibo."
 dvg_granada.9.a:0 "We can't spare the resources, let them have it."
 dvg_granada.10.t:0 "The Spanish Withdraw from New Granada"
 dvg_granada.10.d:0 "The Spanish forces in New Granada are abandoning the colony!"
 dvg_granada.10.f:0 "With de Blanco in control of western New Granada, the Spanish forces have ordered a retreat from the colony. In Medellin, none of two revolutionaries could agree on New Granada’s future. Former Viceroy Rocafuerte sought a monarchy and General de Blanco a centralized republic. Worst of all was that both men insisted that they should assume supreme leadership over whichever nation emerged from the council. The men have declared the meeting a failure and are presumed to be preparing to leave the city, with the future of New Granada still in doubt. One thing is certain... Spain has been cast out of New Granada, but the struggle is not over yet."
 dvg_granada.10.a:0 "We have won the war and now must win the peace."
 dvg_granada.11.t:0 "Rocafuerte Triumphant!"
 dvg_granada.11.d:0 "The monarchist forces have prevailed."
 dvg_granada.11.f:0 "It ended, fittingly, in a church. De Blanco and his men, their forces shattered from repeated defeats by Rocafuerte’s monarchists, took refuge in a small parish near Cartagena. They mounted a last stand which ended when a young captain named Simon Morillo ran into the storehouse being used as a powder room and torched the magazine. The resulting fireball killed himself, de Blanco, and most of the republicans. Though rumors persist of de Blanco’s survival, nearly all the republicans have surrendered."
 dvg_granada.11.a:0 "Hail, oh Fatherland, a thousand times! Oh Fatherland, Glory be to you!"
 dvg_granada.12.t:0 "De Blanco Triumphant!"
 dvg_granada.12.d:0 "The republican forces have prevailed."
 dvg_granada.12.f:0 "After a series of grueling confrontations, de Blanco’s republicans have finally defeated Rocafuerte’s monarchists. The final battle saw Rocafuerte lead his personal guard on a valiant but doomed cavalry charge straight towards de Blanco’s lines, where the would-be emperor perished in his saddle from a rifle shot to the chest."
 dvg_granada.12.a:0 "Hail, oh Fatherland, a thousand times! Oh Fatherland, Glory be to you!"
 dvg_granada.13.t:0 "Truce Between Rocafuerte and de Blanco?"
 dvg_granada.13.d:0 "The Granadan Civil War has been waged for too long."
 dvg_granada.13.f:0 "The revolutionaries de Blanco and Rocafuerte both harbor different visions on how Granada shall be ruled, but none are able to overpower the other. It might be time to finally realize that Granada isn't able to be united under any of them."
 dvg_granada.13.a:0 "We can't go on like that anymore, sign the truce."
 dvg_granada.13.b:0 "Granada WILL be whole again."
 dvg_granada.14.t:0 "The Truce is Signed"
 dvg_granada.14.d:0 "The Granadan revolutionaries agree to stand down."
 dvg_granada.14.f:0 "The Herrera Revolution has ended. With de Blanco and Rocafuerte agreeing to stop hostilities, the future of North Ameriga is uncertain."
 dvg_granada.14.a:0 "Everything has a beginning and an end."
 dvg_granada.15.t:0 "Proclamation of the Granadan Empire"
 dvg_granada.15.d:0 "The Monarchists have triumphed over the Republicans!"
 dvg_granada.15.f:0 "In a grand ceremony in Caracas, Rocafuerte was crowned Antonio I, Emperor of Granada! To encourage support for the new regime, his first act as sovereign was to adopt a limited constitution to lay the realm’s legal foundation and combat charges of absolutism. As the Emperor is an abolitionist, having had many former slaves amongst his llanero raiding parties, he has also ended slavery across Granada."
 dvg_granada.15.a:0 "Viva el Emperador!"
 dvg_granada.16.t:0 "Proclamation of the Kingdom of Aureliana"
 dvg_granada.16.d:0 "The Monarchist cause in Aureliana is successful."
 dvg_granada.16.f:0 "In a grand ceremony in Caracas, Rocafuerte was crowned Antonio I, King of Aureliana! To encourage support for the new regime, his first act as sovereign was to adopt a limited constitution to lay the realm’s legal foundation and combat charges of absolutism. As the King is an abolitionist, having had many former slaves amongst his llanero raiding parties, he has also ended slavery across Aureliana."
 dvg_granada.16.a:0 "Viva el Rey!"
 dvg_granada.17.t:0 "Proclamation of the Granadan Republic"
 dvg_granada.17.d:0 "The Republicans have triumphed over the Monarchists!"
 dvg_granada.17.f:0 "De Blanco returned to Medellin in triumph and was acclaimed by a cheering crowd as the first President of Granada! However, some are already concerned about the intended path of his rule. Though he has organized elections to compose a new legislature, he has upheld wartime censorship and is personally overseeing the redrawing of electoral constituencies. He has also become known for his... strong remarks about Indians and blacks and has remained mute on the issue of slavery. It is hoped that he shall grow into his new role as leader of Granada."
 dvg_granada.17.a:0 "Viva el Presidente!"
 dvg_granada.18.t:0 "Proclamation of the Herrerian Republic"
 dvg_granada.18.d:0 "Herreria emerges as an independent republic."
 dvg_granada.18.f:0 "De Blanco returned to Medellin in triumph and was acclaimed by a cheering crowd as the first President of Herreria!

 dvg_granada.18.a:0 "Viva el Presidente!"
 dvg_granada.19.t:0 "The Dissolution of New Granada"
 dvg_granada.19.d:0 "The Viceroyalty of New Granada, once a beacon of Spanish power, now divided between its own freedom fighters."
 dvg_granada.19.f:0 "New Granada, barely even alive, has already perished at the hands of its supposed liberators. The republicans of Herreria and the monarchists of Aureliana proved unable to overcome one another, and de Blanco and Rocafuerte were forced to partition the embryonic nation after a series of bitter peace negotiations. While each man is now free to shape his country as he sees fit, the dream of a united New Granada has set beyond the horizon like the fading sun. De Blanco and Rocafuerte may go down in history as the fathers of their respective nations, but they will always be foremost remembered as the men who destroyed New Granada for the sake of their own ambitions."
 dvg_granada.19.a:0 "The Granadan state, built on hope, has been strangled in its cradle."
 dvg_granada.20.t:0 "The Dream is Dead"
 dvg_granada.20.d:0 "The warlords of Granada carve out their domains and the dream of united Granada is no more."
 dvg_granada.20.f:0 "With de Blanco's revolutionaries firmly in control of Herreria, Antonio Rocafuerte makes his move and proclaims the Kingdom of Aureliana in Caracas, followed by Guianan separatists in Essequibo. Where once New Granada stood, three new powers have emerged, each with different views on the fate of what was once the Viceroyalty. Despite their best efforts to drive out the Spanish, they could not save the dream of united Granada."
 dvg_granada.20.a:0 "The Granadan dream lies shattered."
