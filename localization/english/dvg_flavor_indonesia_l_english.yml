Rich in untapped resources and filled with people yet to be put to work, power and prestige are the prizes for the victors. Make no mistake: blood will be spilled long before the scramble ends. The East Indies awaits.#!"

 dvg_polynesia.1.t: "The Tui Tonga Empire"
 dvg_polynesia.1.d: "Despite its attempts to become the unopposed hegemonic power of the Pacific Islands since the 10th century, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Empire is largely unknown outside of the region."

 dvg_bali.1.f: "Just like the old empire, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has managed to maintain Hinduism as the state religion and thus sits alone in doing so being surrounded by a sea of sultanates and colonial powers.
