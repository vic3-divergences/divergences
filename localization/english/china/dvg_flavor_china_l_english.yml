 dvg_china.6.f:0 "The republic in its current form was established by men from the Jiangsu area following the fall of the southern Ming to protect the interests of the province against the Shun and the fanatical Xijiao. \n \n However, it is not without its internal issues.

This has earned the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] the nickname "The Tortoise of China" for its role in defending China and its cardinal position in the north."
 dvg_shun.1.f:0 "However, every tortoise still has a softer underbelly. The south is being contested between varying warlords with the grand ambition of conquering the north one day. \n\n Even within our domain, the past 70 years have not been kind to our mandate, having slowed to a causing chaos in the south and political paralysis for two decades.
