 je_wine_blight_reason:0 "Over 40% of French grape vines and vineyards were devastated over a 15-year period from the late 1850s to the mid-1870s. The French economy was badly hit by the blight: many businesses were lost, and wages in the wine industry were cut to less than half. There was also a noticeable trend of migration to places such as Algiers and America. The production of cheap raisins and sugar wines caused the domestic industry several problems that threatened to persist even after the blight itself. The damage to the French economy is estimated to have been slightly over 10 billion Francs. \n Every month, there will be progress toward finding a solution to the blight. Increased chemical technology will increase the rate of research!"

 wine_blight_evt.1.d:0 "The Great Wine Blight was a severe blight of the mid-19th century that destroyed many of the vineyards in Western Europe and laid waste to the wine industry."
 wine_blight_evt.1.f:0 "It was caused by an aphid that originated in North America and was carried across the Atlantic in the late 1850s. The actual genus of the aphid is still debated, although it is largely considered to have been a species of Daktulosphaira vitifoliae, commonly known as grape phylloxera."

 potato_blight.1.d:0 "A mysterious sickness has infested the potato crops in our country. This could spell immense misery and disorder in the near future"
 potato_blight.1.f:0 "The European Potato Failure was a food crisis caused by potato blight that struck Northern and Western Europe in the mid-1840s. The time is also known as the Hungry Forties. While the crisis produced excess mortality and suffering across the affected areas, particularly affected were the Scottish Highlands and, even more harshly, Ireland. Many people starved due to lack of access to other staple food sources."

 potato_blight.3.d:0 "Ireland, already suffering from Malthusian population constraints, is the most potato dependent region in the world. The failure of the potato crop will be apocalyptic in nature. This will surely have ramifications for decades to come."
 potato_blight.3.f:0 "The Irish Potato Famine, was a period of starvation and disease in Ireland from 1845 to 1852 that constituted a historical social crisis which subsequently had a major impact on Irish society and history as a whole.During the Great Hunger, roughly 1 million people died and more than 1 million fled the country, causing the country's population to fall by 20–25% between 1841 and 1871. Between 1845 and 1855, at least 2.1 million people left Ireland, primarily on packet ships but also on steamboats and barques—one of the greatest exoduses from a single island in history."

 potato_blight.7.d:0 "The blight has finally abandoned our soil, yet much discontent remains. The people's collective trauma has hardened them and led many to demand change."
 potato_blight.7.f:0 "In 2019, researched found that the blight was caused by HERB-1, which had originated in the Americas sometime in the early 19th century before spreading to Europe in the 1840s. HERB-1 was responsible for the Great Famine and hundreds of other potato crop failures around the world. It wasn’t until the early 20th century that improvements in crop breeding yielded potato varieties that proved resistant to HERB-1 that the infection was stopped in its tracks. Scientists believe that the HERB-1 strain is now extinct."
