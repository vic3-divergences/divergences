  dvg_hungary.1.t: "The State of the Lands of the Szent Korona (Holy Crown)"
  dvg_hungary.1.d: "The Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen were a battleground between the Jagiellons and the Turks for centuries. Transylvanian Prince Janos II Kemény, descended from the great Hunyadis, was briefly the king of Hungary, Moldavia, and Wallachia in the seventeenth century, but was defeated by simultaneous attacks from the Empire, Poland, and the Turks. The Great Turkish War of the eighteenth century and the Great German War decades later allowed us to eventually oust both powers and win our freedom. Now we find ourselves within an interregnum, with Prince Krisztofer Kemény of Transylvania the leading candidate. However he is a liberal, half-Rumanian Protestant, and unpopular outside of his homeland. Article XVIII of the Treaty of Paris forbids any Jagiellon from ruling Hungary, yet they refuse to return the Szent Korona, vital to Magyar kingship. With our borders temporarily secure, the eastern Protestant and western Catholic magnates are bickering over whether to support Krisztofer or search for someone else."

  dvg_hungary.2.t: "Tensions in Nitra"
  dvg_hungary.2.d: "Some western magnates have begun to begrudgingly accept that Krisztofer's pedigree and personal charisma make him the best choice for the throne. Others have not. One holdout in particular is Duke Gábor IV Zápolya of Nitra, a fiery Catholic zealot of Croatian and Moravian blood whose ancestors fought under the Papal banner in the anti-Hussite crusades. Gábor, denouncing Krisztofer's lack of the Szent Korona and “failure to reclaim” Turkish-held Temesköz, demands that Emperor Sigismund V be crowned instead! This is despite the Treaty of Paris explicitly forbidding a Jagiellon to rule Hungary, not to mention the fact that we are in no condition to attack the Turks…and yet, Sigismund holds both a claim and the Szent Korona. Hungarian law states that the crown itself is a legal person identical to the state of Hungary and superior to the ruling monarch, who rules "in the name of the crown.” No king is truly legitimate without it - yet enthroning the Emperor would create an international catastrophe and would spark a war beyond reckoning."

  dvg_hungary.3.d: "Duke Gabor IV's scheme to install Emperor Sigismund V as King of Hungary forced our hand. We could no longer wait for the return of the Szent Korona. The House of Kemény thus convinced a bare minimum quorum of magnates to support Krisztofer's kingship through bribery and blackmail. To that end, an emergency meeting of the Hungarian Diet was convened in Buda, where, in a solemn ceremony, Prince Krisztofer Kemény of Transylvania was acclaimed “King of the Hungarian Nation,” an archaic but technically sufficient title. This is a temporary measure to award him sorely needed legitimacy until the Szent Korona is returned and he can be properly coronated. Unfortunately, this desperate act has allowed the Duke of Nitra to rally Catholic magnates to his cause by denouncing the procedure as a sham and the new King Krisztofer to be illegitimate. All of Upper Hungary is now awash with reaction, especially among the magnates who refused to attend the Diet."

  dvg_hungary.4.d: "Duke Gabor IV's insubordination has increased in scope. He is now believed to be recruiting support among the western and northern magnates, as well as the Catholic clergy, to contest King Krisztofer's legitimacy. While ordinarily we would arrest him for treason against the monarch, our nation is barely keeping together as it is, and attempting to imprison a duke so popular with the Catholic clergy and the nobility could ignite a civil war. Therefore we are doing our best to keep an eye on the Duke. As of late he has been hosting guests from all over the Catholic regions of Hungary - we presume that he is building support to contest the King's rule. We cannot be certain of how many of his acquaintances have agreed to join his cause, but the possibility of insurrection at least in Upper Hungary in the near future must be considered."

We made various attempts to reclaim it, but Article XVIII of the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Great German War, forbade any Jagiellon to rule Hungary. Now it appears that the matter may be reignited. Duke Gábor IV Zápolya of Nitra is a fervent Catholic who despises the current King, Krisztofer Kemény (descendant of Janos II Kemény who briefly ruled Hungary, Moldavia, and Wallachia). Krisztofer is a liberal, half-Rumanian Protestant from Transylvania, and thus quite controversial. Furthermore, it is we, not Krisztofer, who hold the Holy Crown of Hungary, without which no man can legally rule the kingdom. Krisztofer was forced to take the title of “King of the Hungarian Nation” just to claim any form of legitimacy. It is well-known that the Duke, who is himself part Moravian, admires Sigismund and wishes that he would rule Hungary. Yet such a blatant violation of the Treaty of Paris could ignite an international crisis."

It is now clear that he was indeed recruiting conspirators for a plot against the monarchy, a conspiracy which has moved into action in Nitra City. There, Hungarian magnates and bishops from across the Catholic heartland have convened to hold an illegal and unrecognized Diet. At this meeting, the Duke and his conspirators first declared Krisztofer's acclamation as “King of the Hungarian Nation” to be legally meaningless, and then recognized Emperor Sigismund V as King of Hungary! We were unable to prevent word of this supreme treason from reaching Prague, and are now preparing for the worst. Martial law has been declared across Upper Hungary, and we must prepare for the possibility of civil war or even an invasion by the Holy Roman Empire to place its ruler upon our throne."

There the Duke, and the Archbishop of Pozsony, led the conspirators in recognizing Emperor Sigismund V as King of Hungary! They followed this by requesting that the Emperor bring the Szent Korona and the Reichsarmee south into Hungary, where the magnates shall join forces with him and march to battle against Krisztofer. Sigismund had almost ordered the Reichsarmee to be marshalled before Chancellor Karl von Schwartzenberg reminded him that Article XVIII of the Treaty of Paris explicitly forbade any Jagiellon to rule Hungary. This matter has now reached beyond a mere regional dispute, as it is almost certain that agents of the Scandinavian or Burgundian crown within Prague are on their way back to their masters to relate news of this escalating crisis.#R  If they choose to strike preemptively then we could be facing a new Great German War. #!"

While not quite as obvious a piece of evidence as the actual offer of the crown, we believe that it holds enough information about the Upper Hungarian conspiracy that Scandinavia will be able to piece together the other details.

This is an explicit breach of Article XVIII which ended the decades-long Great German War in 1820 and forced the Jagiellons to annul their claim to Hungary. If the Emperor assumes control of Hungary then their power in Europe would rival that of the Dual Monarchy and they could even attempt to centralize the Empire, just as the mad Marinus Dahlke or Sigismund's own father attempted in the past.

This is a direct breach of Article XVIII (annulling the Jagiellon claim to Hungary) of the Treaty of Paris which ended the devastating Great German War in 1820.

News of this is already spreading across the Empire. Many minor German princes are now questioning the implications of what a Jagiellon Hungary would mean for the Empire at large, and they are not comforted by their answers.

The chamber descended into pandemonium, with the Scandinavian delegation outraged, and the Anglois delegation similarly furious. It seems Burgundy wanted a free Hungary more than a Nordic alliance. The day ended with most delegates abandoning the Congress, and all eyes are now on Scandinavia to see if they will abide by this Faustian bargain between their greatest rival and their once-greatest ally."

This was a clear reference to the Electorate of Bavaria, who had emerged as Austria's rival for Danubian dominance. If Imperial foreign minister Karl von Schwarzenberg refused this request - which was more akin to a demand - then the Austrians were prepared to denounce the Jagiellons in public. Given Austria's role as representative of the minor Imperial princes at large, this would almost certainly ruin any hope of the Emperor gaining internal support for the House of Mecklenburg and thus Pomerania's return.
