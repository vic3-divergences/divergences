 je_golden_liberty:0 "Golden Liberty"
 je_eastern_resistance:0 "The Eastern Troubles"
 je_golden_liberty_reason: "The Szlachta has dominated our politics for centuries and they still make a very important part of our politics, but what was once called The Golden Liberty which made Commonwealth a beacon of tolerance and freedom now drags us down like an iron chain, preventing our state from modernizing, to cure our ills we must either curtail Szlachta's privileges or appease them by cementing their position."
 je_eastern_resistance_reason: "The vast swaths of land that make up our eastern holdings have been largely neglected for the most part of our history and what once made up The Great Kyivan Rus now is place of constant tatar raids and exploitative serfdom of The Szlachta, if we don't end their plight and allow them to flourish within our borders, they eventually will rise up and take the matter into their own hands, which will mean the end of The Commonwealth."
 je_uniting_the_commonwealth:0 "Uniting The Commonwealth"
 je_uniting_the_commonwealth_reason:0 "The rebelious dissidents have been defeated, but there's still work to be done. Our eastern domains have grown quite autonomous as the cause of our king's leniency. Now it's time to rein them in and make them kneel before our king!"
