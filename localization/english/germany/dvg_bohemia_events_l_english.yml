  dvg_zeal_oath: "The Zeal Oath"

  dvg_bohemia.1.t: "The Inauguration of the Kaiser Wenceslaus Plaza"
  dvg_bohemia.1.d: "[concept_dvg_wenceslaus], Holy Roman Emperor, reigned throughout the [concept_dvg_german_revolution] and the subsequent Great German War. An ambitious emperor with cunning and intellect, he had quashed the liberals that had given the Empire so much grief while simultaneously fending off coalition after coalition keen on preventing a Bohemian hegemony over Central Europe."
  dvg_bohemia.1.f: " But he was too successful for his own good, and "the Lion of the North", as he was called after his manyfold victories against the Scandinavians, was eventually forced to sue for peace. He would be murdered the following year and succeeded by his son, Sigismund V, who after a pompous ceremony today had opened a plaza in Prague which lauded his reactionary father’s many achievements. The young emperor promised loftily before a crowd of thousands that his reign will be no less stellar than the last to bear the Imperial Crown.""
  dvg_bohemia.1.a: "The people celebrate an Empire of a thousand years!"

  dvg_bohemia.2.t: "Sigismund V"
  dvg_bohemia.2.d: "Sigismund V came to power at the tender age of ten following his father's unceremonious assassination. Those of his old enemies who survived the Revolution denied their involvement in the affair, and rumors indeed abound that the perpetrators hailed from the Bohemian aristocracy, but it had always been clear to Sigismund V that his father was murdered by the cold hands of liberals and republicans."
  dvg_bohemia.2.f: " Despite his unfortunate upbringing, Sigismund clearly inherited both his father's desires for statecraft and his drive to unite the Empire under Bohemian leadership. His staunch, reactionary inclinations, fostered by his mother and her priest entourage has led to tensions with his Chancellor and former Regent, Karl von Schwarzenberg. Time will tell if the Minister can endure his diplomatic endeavors or if the absolutists inclination of the young emperor will prove too strong."
  dvg_bohemia.2.a: "An industrious man for an industrial era!"

  dvg_bohemia.3.t: "The Zeil Oath"
  dvg_bohemia.3.d: "”My German blood and German treasures I bequeath to a German Constitution, for a German Nation with a German Government of and by and for the German People. This I pledge before God and my fellow oathsworn. Never shall we break and ever shall we gather, for our cause is the cause of the firm and true.”"
  dvg_bohemia.3.f: "Today the people of Frankfurt have proved German liberalism is arisen from ruin as they reenacted that momentous banquet in the Zeil forty years ago, when the Grand Judge of Dortmund proclaimed that all true German sons shall resist and reassemble as necessary against Bohemian tyranny until the Emperor promulgates a liberal Imperial Constitution. Needless to say, the potentates of Germany and beyond wonder aghast at why such an act of treason is tolerated still."
  dvg_bohemia.3.a: "Nothing bad ever happened to Frankfurt!"

  dvg_bohemia.4.t: "The Zeil Oath"
  dvg_bohemia.4.d: "”My German blood and German treasures I bequeath to a German Constitution, for a German Nation with a German Government of and by and for the German People. This I pledge before God and my fellow oathsworn. Never shall we break and ever shall we gather, for our cause is the cause of the firm and true.”"
  dvg_bohemia.4.f: "News reached Prague today of notable German liberals having held a banquet in Frankfurt, intently reenacting the infamous and especially treasonous Zeil Oath. Whereas Bohemia proper is crying foul at such a blatant insult to Imperial authority, the Elbians and Danubians are ecstatically celebrating the revival of German liberalism at its very cradle. Time will tell if this heralds a return to the dark days of 1790..."
  dvg_bohemia.4.a: "Liberalism runs onwards, powered by the approval of the true Germans."

  dvg_bohemia.5.t: "Creation of the Wolfgang Society"
  dvg_bohemia.5.d: "The elder branch of the House of Jagiellon, to which the kings of Bohemia belong, deeply distrust the intentions of the cadet branch Jagiellon-Karlstein, which would succeed to the throne of Bohemia should the senior branch die out."
  dvg_bohemia.5.f: " Sigismund Ludwig Wolfgang von Jagiellon-Karlstein is the head of this cadet branch which grew infamous during the Great German War for having championed the liberal cause. This eventually led to the assassination of the father of Wolfgang, who dropped his first two names which were associated with the elder branch. Today, Wolfgang von Jagiellon-Karlstein announced in Dresden the creation of the Wolfgang Society which occupies itself with reformist tendencies, which seem to have gained ground among our population. Further observation of the situation is the only thing we can do for now."
  dvg_bohemia.5.a: "Reforms? In Bohemia? With Sigismund V?"

  dvg_bohemia.6.t: "The Bayreuth Constitution of $YEAR$"
  dvg_bohemia.6.d: "In the years after the Great German War, the Electorate of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, formerly a staunch reactionary stronghold who allied with Wenceslaus V and received Nürnberg as a reward, transformed itself into a beacon of liberalism and hope for the peoples of Germany."
  dvg_bohemia.6.f: " Prince-Elector Leopold IV, Duke of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, and his almost obsessive sponsorship of various intellectuals and creative artists are among the reasons behind the proclamation by the chancellor August von Rixdorf of a charter granting basic rights to the subjects of the Bayreuth throne, and introducing a democratically elected parliament with actual legislative powers. With the obvious inspiration taken from the Zeil Oath, concerns are raised over a potential interference by Sigismund V of Bohemia who warned of such actions in the wake of his ascension to the crown of Bohemia."
  dvg_bohemia.6.a: "Reformation is better than a new revolution!"

  dvg_bohemia.10.t: "The Fall of von Schwarzenberg"
  dvg_bohemia.10.d: "History would first remember Karl von Schwarzenberg as the Architect of Europe, the mind behind the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris] which led Bohemia to its present esteem despite the inconclusive Great German War, then as Imperial Regent for Sigismund V following Wenceslaus IV's untimely death, then as Chancellor of the Holy Roman Empire."
  dvg_bohemia.10.f: "Despite his many titles, however, his former charge would prove no large amount of them can quell an Emperor incensed when he released the now-former Chancellor from his duties following the dismal outcome of the Hungarian Conference. Sigismund later appointed as his new Chancellor Josef von Nostitz-Drzewiecky, an old family friend, to neither fanfare nor outcry."
  dvg_bohemia.10.a: "Such is the Emperor's will."

  dvg_bohemia.11.t: "Following the Bayreuth Constitution"
  dvg_bohemia.11.d: "Exile poets, would-be revolutionaries and other such liberal apologists have streamed to Brandenburg-Bayreuth in increasing numbers ever since its lunatic chancellery enacted reform after reform under the Bayreuth Constitution's remit."
  dvg_bohemia.11.f: " While this is a clear affront to Imperial authority over Germany, normally resolved through a 'thorough restoration of the status quo', the Emperor had granted von Nostitz-Drzewiecky his blessing to resolve 'the situation in Bayreuth' as he saw fit. Those beseeching clemency for the liberals were countermanded by those who claim the Charter's continued existence undermines the Empire's stability, leaving it vulnerable to Burgundian and Scandinavian infiltration. Yet the Ewiger Landfriede, strengthened by the Treaty of Paris, forbids using military force to solve internal Imperial disputes - except in cases of dire emergency. Having considered both perspectives, the Chancellor said…"
  dvg_bohemia.11.a: "Their 'Constitution' will make fine boot scrubbers for our men!"
  #dvg_bohemia.11.b: "Germanos omittamus. Now is no time for bloodshed." #removed due to breaking event chains

  dvg_bohemia.12.t: "The $YEAR$ Great Fire of Nuremberg"
  dvg_bohemia.12.d: "The days that followed the tragedy were rife with finger-pointing. The aggrieved of Nuremberg cast theirs at a squad of Bohemians who'd set fire to a bakery after shooting everyone within : the Imperial Army denies such malice aforethought."
  dvg_bohemia.12.f: " Whichever the truth, its resulting facts lay clear in three quarters of a once-proud city in cinders, and thousands of charred corpses to come along with. While the good Duke Leopold nurses his wounds in Londres and his more conservative brother Hermann III bears the onerous task of rebuilding his capital, Sigismund returns to Prague having lit a fire not just in Nuremberg but in the heart of every German from the Danube to the Rhine."
  dvg_bohemia.12.a: "Let the city light our way to order."

  dvg_bohemia.13.t: "Das Nürnberglied"
  dvg_bohemia.13.d: "Das Nürnberglied, the Nuremberg Song, is an anthem written by Gottfried Wilhelm Eisler as a reaction to the Great Fire of Nuremberg."
  dvg_bohemia.13.f: " The first line, "Deutsches Blut, geflossen in der kalten Nacht" (usually translated into English as "German blood was shed in the cold night"), was an appeal to the various German monarchs to give the creation of a constitution that respects the individual human a higher priority than the independence of their small states. In the third stanza, with a call for "Gleichheit, Einheit, Freiheit" (equality, unity, freedom), Eisler expressed his desire for a united and free Germany where the rule of law, not monarchical arbitrariness, would prevail. Due to the contemporary tense atmosphere, many liberals and intellectuals have began to use these three words as a campaigning slogan against the lacking guarantee of rights for the people."
  dvg_bohemia.13.a: "A dream reborn."

  dvg_bohemia.14.t: "A Headless Lion"
  dvg_bohemia.14.d: "His Imperial Majesty the Emperor has begun to reconsider his neglect of the foreign office. Up until now it was the opinion of our sovereign that it represented a needless drain on the treasury, and that he and his cabinet could handle things by themselves."
  dvg_bohemia.14.f: " The disaster in Nuremberg, however, has thrown that into question. Emperor Sigismund has begrudgingly come to terms with his relative inexperience in orchestrating foreign policy, especially after numerous reports of anti-Jagiellon sentiment flaring up across southern Germany the likes of which have not been seen since the days of Marinus Dahlke. Thus he has reinvested new funds into the foreign office and reappointed Karl von Schwarzenberg as Chancellor, awarding Josef von Nostitz-Drzewiecky a substantial sinécure as compensation."
  dvg_bohemia.14.a: "We can still undo the damages!"

  dvg_bohemia.15.t: "The Obvious Demand"
  dvg_bohemia.15.d: "The Burning of Nuremberg has shocked all of Germany but what worries Wilhelm IV goes beyond this incident. The Emperor has, on his own initiative, broken the Ewiger Landfriede and removed a prince of the Empire, and not just anyone, but one of the seven Electors."
  dvg_bohemia.15.f: " This unparalleled assault upon the rights of the Imperial Princes of the Blood cannot be tolerated! We must defend the rights of the Electors, and of our fellow Danubian Germans. To this end, Duke-Elector Wilhelm has taken two actions. First he held a meeting of princes and bishops from across the German highlands to draft a petition to the Emperor demanding a convocation of the Reichstag to hold a vote on the fate of Bayreuth. He has also organized a broader council meeting of German princes to be held in Munich whether or not the Emperor permits the Reichstag to be convened. If the Reichstag fails us then we may need to take extreme measures to protect the rights of our people from the Emperor…possibly including a new union of princes to defend against him."
  dvg_bohemia.15.a: "We shall not be slaughtered!"

  dvg_bohemia.16.t: "An Envoy from Bavaria"
  dvg_bohemia.16.d: "The Emperor's dissolution of the Electorate of Bayreuth has sent shockwaves throughout the Empire. Nobody knows where the sovereign's autocratic streak will end and few are interested in finding out."
  dvg_bohemia.16.f: " Now Duke-Elector Wilhelm IV of Bavaria has decided to take action. He has petitioned for an immediate Reichstag vote on the fate of Bayreuth, but he has also announced the convening of a pan-German council to discuss possible measures to defend against further Imperial encroachment. None of our ministers can say where such discussions may lead but it is obvious that further German unity is necessary if we are to survive Sigismund's predations."
  dvg_bohemia.16.a: "Of course we will attend the meeting."

  dvg_bohemia.17.t: "The Danubian Petition"
  dvg_bohemia.17.d: "Our dissolution of the Electorate of Bayreuth and the subsequent Fire of Nuremberg has raised hackles along the Danube, and no German realm is more angered by our actions than Bavaria."
  dvg_bohemia.17.f: "This act of royal interference in defiance of the Ewiger Landfriede has especially angered the Danubians as it was an attack on one of their own cultural kin. Thus the Bavarians and other Danubian princes and bishops have demanded an immediate convocation of the Reichstag to hold a vote on the fate of Bayreuth. Ominously, Duke-Elector Wilhelm IV of Bavaria has also organized a pan-German council in Munich to rally German nationalism against Imperial control. Thus the Emperor is tempted to reject the petition in order to demonstrate his displeasure at Bavaria's actions, but von Schwartzenberg has urged him to at the very least withdraw all Bohemian troops from Bayreuth as an act of goodwill. Allowing the vote will almost certainly lead to the princes voting in Leopold's favor and will humiliate us before our own vassals."
  dvg_bohemia.17.a: "Hold the vote, if the princes want Leopold to be an elector again."
  #dvg_bohemia.17.b: "Hermann shall remain Elector of Bayreuth, but without our bayonets." #disabled since its usless
  dvg_bohemia.17.c: "Bohemian troops will remain in Bayreuth!"


  dvg_bohemia.20.t: "An Emperor in Name Alone"
  dvg_bohemia.20.d: "In 1790, the liberal Emperor [concept_dvg_wenceslaus] was assassinated by a Bohemian officer and the conservative [concept_dvg_wenceslaus] undid his reforms. In response, liberal revolutionaries swore an oath in Zeil-Street, Frankfurt, to create a new Imperial Republic and shatter the First and Second Estates (the clergy and nobility)."
  dvg_bohemia.20.f: " Lieutenant-Colonel [concept_dvg_dahlke] led the defection of much of the Reichsarmee to the Republic, won several important battles, and then proclaimed himself Consul of the Republic. His attempts to destroy European monarchism eventually led to his overthrow, but Wenceslaus V then tried to centralize the Empire, setting off a new series of conflicts. This Great German War, and the Treaty of Paris that ended it in 1820, has crippled the Empire. Wenceslaus V had almost made us a true nation-state, but the Imperial Estates once again rule on their own. Sigismund was a child during his reign, and with the end of the regency, he now stands where Charles IV of Luxembourg stood in 1300 : having to rebuild the Empire almost from scratch."
  dvg_bohemia.20.a: "Long live Sigismund V, Holy Roman Emperor of the German Nation!"


  dvg_bohemia.21.t: "Renegotiating the Erfurt Agreement"
  dvg_bohemia.21.d: "After the Great German War and the subsequent peace treaties, the Ernestine duchies signed the Erfurt Agreement of 1823. This prevented further partitioning and laid clear guidelines for the division of land should a ducal line be extinguished, but, all lines survived and the agreement was revised."
  dvg_bohemia.21.f: " This new agreement created the 'confederation' of Ducal Saxony. All duchies are sovereign but their laws and taxes are synchronized under a central government with a new unitary flag. Saxe-Meiningen-Eisenach was excluded from several clauses of the Erfurt Agreement due to its unique laws but its economic stagnation has caused it to seek renegotiation. The dukes intend to reorganize under the banner of the old Duchy of Thuringia, their titular ancestor, but we may want to force them to accept special Imperial protection to keep them loyal.#R  We must remember that the Treaty of Paris curtailed Imperial authority. From this moment on, whenever we intervene in our Imperial Estates, we will be increasing the risk of a new Great German War. #!""
  dvg_bohemia.21.a: "We will not interfere. Imperial consolidation is long overdue."
  dvg_bohemia.21.b: "Ducal Saxony must replace foreign influences with our protection."

  dvg_bohemia.22.t: "The Riots in Bremen"
  dvg_bohemia.22.d: "The Scandinavian garrison of the Free Imperial City of Bremen has long been loathed by Bremeners, ever since the ousting of Dahlkist mayor Caspar Thiele during the Imperial Revolutions."
  dvg_bohemia.22.f: "Long gone are the days of the controversial, half-Nordic, yet still popular mayor Hermann von Lettow, who, despite inviting Scandinavian forces to the city, managed to spare Bremen from much of the devastation of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution] and secure its independence in the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris] as one of the few delegates from an Imperial Free City. His successor Walther Raschen inspires no such love from the citizenry, who now see Bremen as an occupied territory. The government's fear of prosecuting Scandinavian soldiers' crimes has given rise to independent citizen militias. These militias, demanding the resignation of Raschen and the immediate expulsion of Scandinavian troops, are now rioting the Marktplatz and several small fires have already been ignited by their attacks. Rachen in turn has demanded that the Scandinavians help the city guard restore order…"
  dvg_bohemia.22.a: "Bremen must not fall into anarchy!"

  dvg_bohemia.23.t: "The Bremen Affair"
  dvg_bohemia.23.d: "We occupied the Imperial Free City of Bremen during the Imperial Revolutions at the request of German-Scandinavian aristocrat Hermann von Lettow, ousting Dahlkist mayor Caspar Thiele. But von Lettow died in office and was replaced by the reactionary Walther Raschen."
  dvg_bohemia.23.f: "Repeated accusations have been made that the Bremen courts are afraid to charge our troops (despite the Treaty of Paris which ended the Great German War permitting our garrison to only use force in self-defense). In turn, independent citizen militias have formed. Recently they converged upon the Markplatz, where they first demanded Raschen's resignation and the expulsion of our troops, then began to riot, threatening to set the city ablaze. Our soldiers, at Raschen's request, violently put down the mob. Now Copenhagen papers speak of the “Bremen Massacre,” allowing the liberals to paint the Unionsters as barbarians. The Elbian Germans across the realm are now protesting, denouncing us as occupiers, and martial law has been declared in Bremen, Holstein, and Pomerania."
  dvg_bohemia.23.a: "And what was the alternative? Let Raschen die and the city burn?"

  dvg_bohemia.24.t: "The Bremen Massacre"
  dvg_bohemia.24.d: "Scandinavia has occupied the Free Imperial City of Bremen ever since they ousted Dahlkist mayor Caspar Thiele during the Imperial Revolutions."
  dvg_bohemia.24.f: " This was at the request of his replacement, the controversial, half-Nordic, yet still popular Hermann von Lettow, who managed to spare Bremen from much of the devastation of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution] and secure its independence in the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris] as one of the few delegates from an Imperial Free City. His successor was the reactionary Walther Raschen. Rumors that the Bremener courts would not prosecute Nordic soldiers gave rise to independent citizen militias. These militias staged a riot in the Marktplatz to demand the resignation of Raschen and the expulsion of Scandinavian troops. Raschen summoned the Scandinavians, and the garrison shot and beat the crowd into submission. Scandinavia has placed their own German territories under martial law. Needless to say, use of force against Imperial citizens by the garrison was forbidden by the Treaty of Paris except in self-defense."
  dvg_bohemia.24.a: "Savagery, thy name is Scandinavia!"

  dvg_bohemia.25.t: "The Schwerin Clash"
  dvg_bohemia.25.d: "Ever since the 17th century, the Arch-Kingdom of Scandinavia and has held the duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Pomerania, despite both officially lying within the Empire."
  dvg_bohemia.25.f: " Over the years, Scandinavia's administration has led to the term “Pomerania” starting to encompass the whole territory. However, the ancient House of Mecklenburg still survives in the cadet branch of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who still cling to their last county with Imperial protection. Now the Bremen Massacre and the resulting imposition of martial law by Scandinavia has sparked clashes throughout Mecklenburg. The violence has even spread to the Schwerin border, with Germans on both sides demanding the reunification of the Duchy and the removal of all Scandinavian influence from northern Germany. Scandinavia's grip on the Ostsee coast appears weaker than ever before, something that we should look to exploit in our quest to reunify the Empire."
  dvg_bohemia.25.a: "Contact the Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Let's make a deal…"
