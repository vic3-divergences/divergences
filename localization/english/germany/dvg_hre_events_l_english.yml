  dvg_hre.1.t: "Imperial incident: The Bayreuth Constitution"
  dvg_hre.1.d: "In the years after the Great German War, the Electorate of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, formerly a staunch reactionary stronghold who allied with Wenceslaus V and received Nürnberg as a reward, transformed itself into a beacon of liberalism and hope for the peoples of Germany."
  dvg_hre.1.f: "Prince-Elector Leopold IV, Duke of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, and his almost obsessive sponsorship of various intellectuals and creative artists are among the reasons behind the proclamation by the chancellor August von Rixdorf of a charter granting basic rights to the subjects of the Bayreuth throne, and introducing a democratically elected parliament with actual legislative powers. With the obvious inspiration taken from the Zeil Oath, concerns are raised over a potential interference by Sigismund V of Bohemia who warned of such actions in the wake of his ascension to the crown of Bohemia."
  dvg_hre.1.a: "Sigismund will not be happy"

  dvg_hre.2.t: "The Great Fire of Nürnberg"
  dvg_hre.2.d: "The days that followed the tragedy were rife with finger-pointing. The aggrieved of Nürnberg cast theirs at a squad of Bohemians who'd set fire to a bakery after shooting everyone within : the Imperial Army denies such malice aforethought."
  dvg_hre.2.f: "Whichever the truth, its resulting facts lay clear in three quarters of a once-proud city in cinders, and thousands of charred corpses to come along with. While the good Duke Leopold nurses his wounds in Londres and his more conservative brother Hermann III bears the onerous task of rebuilding his capital, Sigismund returns to Prague having lit a fire not just in Nuremberg but in the heart of every German from the Danube to the Rhine."
  dvg_hre.2.a: "Let the city light our way to order."

  dvg_hre.3.t: "Das Nürnberglied"
  dvg_hre.3.d: "Tragedy has struck Nürmberg. Bohemian Soldiers have been accused to set fire to the city of Nürnberg. Das Nürnberglied, the Nuremberg Song, is an anthem written by Gottfried Wilhelm Eisler as a reaction to the Great Fire of Nürnberg."
  dvg_hre.3.f: "The first line, ”Deutsches Blut, geflossen in der kalten Nacht” (”German blood was shed in the cold night”), was an appeal to the various German monarchs to give the creation of a constitution that respects the individual human a higher priority than the independence of their small states. In the third stanza, with a call for ”Gleichheit, Einheit, Freiheit” (equality, unity, freedom), Eisler expressed his desire for a united and free Germany where the rule of law, not monarchical arbitrariness, would prevail. Due to the contemporary tense atmosphere, many liberals and intellectuals have began to use these three words as a campaigning slogan against the lacking guarantee of rights for the people."
  dvg_hre.3.a: "A dream reborn."

  dvg_hre.4.t: "The Electorate of Baden"
  dvg_hre.4.d: "Recently the Electorate of Bayreuth has become subject to another nation. Since they are an Elector the Emperor must handle the Situation and decide waht todo."

  dvg_hre.4.a: "The Emperor will see to this at once."

  dvg_hre.5.t: "An Imperial Offer"
  dvg_hre.5.d: "On paper Baden is part of the Holy Roman Empire. But since it borders with Burgundy the reality is another. Willing or not Baden is more aligned with Burgundy than it is with the emperor. A recent proposial was made by the emperor itself. Since Bayreuth does not seem fit for the Title of Elector anymore Bohemia has offerd this title to us. This would significatnly increase the influence of the Emperor in our lands and move us away from the Burgundians."
  dvg_hre.5.f: "Electors have bevome somewhat of a prestige title at best. ~ A burgundian ambassador"
  dvg_hre.5.a: "We gladly accept"

  dvg_hre.6.t: "The Emperor demands"
  dvg_hre.6.d: "Occupying the electorate of Bayreuth is a violation of Imperial Law. Therefore the emperor has demanded the immediate release of Bayreuth. Failing to do so would result in a conflict with the emperor itself."

  dvg_hre.6.a: "Back down"
  dvg_hre.6.b: "Ready the army"

  dvg_hre.7.t: "The free city of Ulm"
  dvg_hre.7.d: "The city of Ulm has been a powderkeg for some time. Liberals have failed a coup in the past and since then both Bavaria and Baden have placed garrison in the city to maintain order. These garrison however have caused alot of stife as both parties have started to claim the city for themselfs. With the ties of Baden and the Emeperor renewed a formal request was forwarded to the emperor. He has to decide which garrison must leave the city. Giving the Ulm to Baden would greatly increase their legitimacy and would probably enable them to unity the swabian duchies. Handing it over to Bavaria would hamper this ambition greatly."
  dvg_hre.7.f: "Maybe a united swabia would pose a good balance against Burgundy. ~ A unknown court member"

  dvg_hre.10.t: "The rising Lion of Swabia"
  dvg_hre.10.d: "In the recent years Baden has gained significant influence over the swabian region. This influence has now reached us. A proposial or better a demand for unification has reached us. We can not count on support from the emperor in this matter."
  dvg_hre.10.f: ""
  dvg_hre.10.a: "Unfortunate"

  dvg_hre.11.t: "The unification of Swabia"
  dvg_hre.11.d: "News have reached Prague of the unification of Swabia under the rule of the Hohenzollern Dynasty. While we have been suporting thise development it has not come with only benefits. Stronger powers within the empire means more rivalry. Bavaria had allready mobilized its troops. Gladly we could intervene but this has left cracks in the facade that is the Empire."
