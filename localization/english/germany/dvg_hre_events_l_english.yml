  dvg_hre.1.t: "Imperial incident: The Bayreuth Constitution"
  dvg_hre.1.d: "In the years after the Great German War, the Electorate of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, formerly a staunch reactionary stronghold who allied with Wenceslaus V and received Nürnberg as a reward, transformed itself into a beacon of liberalism and hope for the peoples of Germany."
  dvg_hre.1.f: "Prince-Elector Leopold IV, Duke of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, and his almost obsessive sponsorship of various intellectuals and creative artists are among the reasons behind the proclamation by the chancellor August von Rixdorf of a charter granting basic rights to the subjects of the Bayreuth throne, and introducing a democratically elected parliament with actual legislative powers. With the obvious inspiration taken from the Zeil Oath, concerns are raised over a potential interference by Sigismund V of Bohemia who warned of such actions in the wake of his ascension to the crown of Bohemia."
  dvg_hre.1.a: "Sigismund will not be happy"

  dvg_hre.2.t: "The Great Fire of Nürnberg"
  dvg_hre.2.d: "The days that followed the tragedy were rife with finger-pointing. The aggrieved of Nürnberg cast theirs at a squad of Bohemians who'd set fire to a bakery after shooting everyone within: the Imperial Army denies such malice aforethought."
  dvg_hre.2.f: "Whichever the truth, with three quarters of the once-proud city in cinders and charred corpses littering the streets, someone is bound to take the fall. While the good Duke Leopold nurses his wounds in Londres and his more conservative brother Hermann III bears the onerous task of rebuilding his capital, Sigismund returns to Prague having lit a fire not just in Nuremberg but in the heart of every German from the Danube to the Rhine."
  dvg_hre.2.a: "Let the city light our way to order."

  dvg_hre.3.t: "Das Nürnberglied"
  dvg_hre.3.d: "Tragedy has struck Nürnberg. Bohemian Soldiers have been accused of setting fire to the city. Das Nürnberglied, the Nuremberg Song, is an anthem written by Gottfried Wilhelm Eisler as a reaction to the Great Fire of Nürnberg."
  dvg_hre.3.f: "The first line, ”Deutsches Blut, geflossen in der kalten Nacht” (”German blood was shed in the cold night”), was an appeal to the various German monarchs to give the creation of a constitution that respects the individual human a higher priority than the independence of their small states. In the third stanza, with a call for ”Gleichheit, Einheit, Freiheit” (equality, unity, freedom), Eisler expressed his desire for a united and free Germany where the rule of law, not monarchical arbitrariness, would prevail. Due to the contemporary tense atmosphere, many liberals and intellectuals have began to use these three words as a campaigning slogan against the lacking guarantee of rights for the people."
  dvg_hre.3.a: "A dream reborn."

  dvg_hre.4.t: "Imperial Electorate under threat"
  dvg_hre.4.d: "Recently the Electorate of Bayreuth has become a subject. Since they are an Elector, the Emperor must handle the situation and decide what to do."
  dvg_hre.4.f: "Navigating the delicate web of the Holy Roman Empire's diplomacy was never an easy task."
  dvg_hre.4.a: "The Emperor will see to this at once."

  dvg_hre.5.t: "An Imperial Offer"
  dvg_hre.5.d: "On paper Baden is part of the Holy Roman Empire. Due to its proximity to Burgundy, the reality is different. Willing or not Baden is more aligned with Burgundy than it is with the emperor. A recent proposal was put forward by the emperor himself. Since Bayreuth does not seem fit for the title of Elector anymore Bohemia has offerd this title to us. This would significatnly increase the influence of the Emperor in our lands and move us away from the Burgundians."
  dvg_hre.5.f: "Electors have become somewhat of a prestige title at best. ~ Joannes Coenraad Jansen (Burgundian ambassador to Baden)"
  dvg_hre.5.a: "We gladly accept"

  dvg_hre.6.t: "The Emperor's demands"
  dvg_hre.6.d: "Occupying the electorate of Bayreuth is a violation of Imperial Law. Therefore the emperor has demanded the immediate release of Bayreuth. Failing to do so would result in a conflict with the emperor itself."
  dvg_hre.6.f: ""
  dvg_hre.6.a: "Back down"
  dvg_hre.6.b: "Ready the army"

  dvg_hre.7.t: "The free city of Ulm"
  dvg_hre.7.d: "The city of Ulm has been a powderkeg for some time. Liberals have failed a coup in the past and since then both Bavaria and Baden have placed garrisons in the city to maintain order. These garrisons are causing discourse throughout the city, as both parties have started to claim the city for themselves. With the ties of Baden and the Emperor renewed a formal request was forwarded to the Emperor. He has to decide which garrison must leave the city. Giving the city of Ulm to Baden would greatly increase their legitimacy and would probably enable them to unify the Swabian duchies. Handing it over to Bavaria would hamper this ambition greatly."
  dvg_hre.7.f: "Maybe a united Swabia would pose as a good balance against Burgundy. ~ Antonin von Suttner (Bohemian nobleman)"
  dvg_hre.7.a: "Bavaria shall have it."
  dvg_hre.7.b: "Baden shall have it."

  dvg_hre.8.t: "The Ulm decree"
  dvg_hre.8.d: "To maintain stability and order within the Empire. We task [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to defend the order of things within the city of Ulm until we see otherwise."
  dvg_hre.8.f: "A matter settled."
  dvg_hre.8.a: "As to be expected."

  dvg_hre.9.t: "We have been scorned"
  dvg_hre.9.d: "The city of Ulm has been a powderkeg for some time. Liberals have failed a coup in the past and since then both Bavaria and Baden have placed garrisons in the city to maintain order. In an unforseen turn of events the Emperor decided to ban our garrison from the city of Ulm. "
  dvg_hre.9.f: "This matter was to be settled without the Emperor. Clearly a sign of imperial overreach!"
  dvg_hre.9.a: "Outrageous!"

  dvg_hre.10.t: "The rising Lion of Swabia"
  dvg_hre.10.d: "In the recent years Baden has gained significant influence over the swabian region. This influence has now reached us. A proposial or better a demand for unification has reached us. We can not count on support from the Emperor in this matter."
  dvg_hre.10.f: "The Emperor has clearly picked a side in this conflict. At least we did not run to Prague for help!"
  dvg_hre.10.a: "This is clearly a sign of imperial overreach!"

  dvg_hre.11.t: "The unification of Swabia"
  dvg_hre.11.d: "News has reached Prague of the unification of Swabia under the rule of the Hohenzollern Dynasty. While we have been supporting this development it has its caveats. Stronger powers within the Empire means more opposition to our control. Bavaria has already mobilized its troops. We could intervene, but our meddling has already left cracks in the facade that is the Empire."
  dvg_hre.11.f: "Was erlauben sie sich!"
  dvg_hre.11.a: "The future is uncertain"

  dvg_hre.12.t: "Riots in Bremen"
  dvg_hre.12.d: "Bremen has been in a special situation within the empire. Since the Great German War the city has been host to a Scandinavian garrison. Now news of violent riots in the city have spread around the empire. Details are uncertain at this point but some sources report several dead and wounded on both sides of the riots. We can use this incident to get rid of any scandinavian influence in the city."
  dvg_hre.12.f: "We walk a narrow path. The Danes will most likely not go peacefully!"
  dvg_hre.12.a: "Demand immediate withdrawal from the city"
  dvg_hre.12.b: "We cant risk conflict with Scandinavia right now"

  dvg_hre.13.t: "The Emperor's demands."
  dvg_hre.13.d: "Bremen has been in a special situation within the empire. Since the great german war the city has been host to a Scandinavian garrison. Now news of violent riots in the city have spread around the empire. Details are uncertain at this point but some sources report several dead and wounded on both sides of the riots. The Emperor now has demanded we withdraw our garrison and allow the Imperial Army to restore order. Imperial units are already moving to surround the city."
  dvg_hre.13.f: "This is a daring move, Sigismund certainly is not weakminded."
  dvg_hre.13.a: "Bremen is not worth a war."
  dvg_hre.13.b: "Tighten our grip."

  dvg_hre.14.t: "Scandinavian garrison leaves Bremen."
  dvg_hre.14.d: "After a tense standoff between Bohemian and Scandinavian forces, Scandinavia hads withdrawn their troops. This afternoon imperial troops have returned to the city and were welcomed as liberators. A city wide festival has been announced by the mayor, as well as a yearly holiday. Decennia of occupation has left its scars on both the city and the people of Bremen. Mothers and wives grieve over their fallen sons and husbands who died to Scandinavian weapons."
  dvg_hre.14.f: "A great victory for the German people! Organise a banquet for the mayor in Prague."
  dvg_hre.14.a: "Wonderful."
  
  dvg_hre.15.t: "Scandinavian garrison occupies Bremen."
  dvg_hre.15.d: "To prevent further riots Scandinavia has fully closed down the city of Bremen and effectively cut it off from the Empire. No news has reached us about the happenings within the city itself. Imperial troops surrounding the city await their orders as rumours about the upcoming conflict start to appear. If the Emperor doesnt react another brick falls of the facade of our 'great' Empire."
  dvg_hre.15.f: "'This is certainly a predicament...' ~ Gustaf Nils Algernon Adolf Stjerneld (Scandinavian ambassador to Bohemia)"
  dvg_hre.15.a: "They have chosen violence!"
  dvg_hre.15.b: "We must back down."

  dvg_hre.16.t: "The Thuringian Succession"
  dvg_hre.16.d: "The lands of Germany are still mostly fudal. Often bigger domains splinter into pieces or errupt into war after a ruler dies. To prevent this some realms have created special laws to regulate the inheritance. This often comes into effect if several cadet branches exist. So was the case for Thuringia. In this instance a law was in place if one branch of the dynasty would be extinct. With the ruling Dynasty of Saxe-Meiningen-Eisenach dying out Thuringia has made moves to unify. Usually this would not be a concern for the Emperor but recently Thuringia has been reported to strengthen their ties with Burgundy. Of course a Burgundian defacto puppet can not be tolerated directly on our Border. That is why the Emperor must decide how to act."
  dvg_hre.16.f: "'The growing influence of Burgundy is a danger to the Empire. Even worse, to the German people!' ~ Alphonse von Rothschild (Austrian nobleman and banker)"
  dvg_hre.16.a: "They better not try anything"

  dvg_hre.17.t: "The Thuringian Succession - Just Rumors"
  dvg_hre.17.d: "As it turned out the Burgundians were not involved in Thuringia at all. Maybe some dissidents tried to spread these rumors to force the Emperor to intervene and drive the Thuringians away from Prague."
  dvg_hre.17.f: "Luckily we were not too impulsive. Otherwise the Empire would be in deep trouble."
  dvg_hre.17.a: "A disaster avoided."

  dvg_hre.18.t: "The Thuringian Succession - A Meeting in Erfurt"
  dvg_hre.18.d: "Some times no action is the best action. In this case the Emperor has decided to get involved in a succession he should have not. As it turned out Thuringia had no intention of aligning with Burgundy but the sudden distrust of the Emperor has left a stain on the relations between the two nations. To make matters worse a newspaper has caught wind and published the affair."
  dvg_hre.18.f: "'Patience is passion tamed' ~ Lyman Abbot"
  dvg_hre.18.a: "Terrible news"

  dvg_hre.19.t: "The Rise of the Hohenzollern"
  dvg_hre.19.d: "As the Hohenzollern Dynasty consolidates power, their ambitions threaten to reshape the balance of power within the Empire. The Emperor must decide how to respond to this growing influence."
  dvg_hre.19.f: "A pivotal moment in our history."
  dvg_hre.19.a: "Let them be."
  dvg_hre.19.b: "We must act decisively."

  dvg_hre.20.t: "The Pommeranian Question"
  dvg_hre.20.d: "The Duchy of Pomerania has been a point of contention for some time. With our recent liberation of northern Germany, we are expected to restore the dutchy of Pommerania and Mecklenburg."
  dvg_hre.20.f: "The Emperor has made his decision."
  dvg_hre.20.a: "We will restore the Duchy of Pomerania and Mecklenburg."
  dvg_hre.20.b: "We will not restore the Duchy of Pomerania and Mecklenburg."
