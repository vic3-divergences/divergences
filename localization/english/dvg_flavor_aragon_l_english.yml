 dvg_aragon.1.t: "The Crown of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_aragon.1.d: ";The beginning of the XIXth century has been hard for the old crown of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 dvg_aragon.1.f: "The beginning of the XIXth century has been hard for the old crown of Aragon. After the incompetence and corruption of the reign of Ferran VI Borja which saw the Aragonese nearly lose their Italian possessions because of the Etrurian revolution and the Santamarian insurrections in Naples his brother and heir Ferran VI died after only 44 days of rule. His daughter Maria was cast aside by the legitimized bastard of Joan IV Josep of Serna who now rules the Crown and its various territories. Numerous challenges await the monarch : North Africa is far from being pacified with a rebellion of Berber tribes spilling over the Aragonese settlements. Italy remains a divided mess : our Sicilian holdings are plagued by banditry and plotters while the Etrurian republic still lives although the most revolutionary factions are inactive for now. Both Burgundy and the Dual-Monarchy influence the Northern princes and among them Milan may especially prove troublesome."

 dvg_aragon.2.t: "The Escape of Maria Borja"
 dvg_aragon.2.d: "Following her deposition by the Cortes General and the annulation of her betrothal to the duke of Milan Maria Borja has lived under house arrest on the island of Capri in the bay of Naples.Then, just the other night she boarded a Genoan ship bought by the duke of Milan and she arrived in Genoa before any Aragonese ships could arrest her and from there joined Massimiliano Maria heir of Leopoldo I in Milan where they were wed in great pomp."
 dvg_aragon.2.f: "While posing a threat to Josep Serna because of her legitimacy she was always seen as easily manipulated and not worth much surveillance. In these conditions the news of her escape as a great surprise to the Aragonese government. So far Maria has announced that she will not renegate her abdication and that she had formally renounced her claim to the Kingdom of Aragon but many legitimists gather throughout the Crown calling for the return of the 'Queen in Milan'."

 dvg_aragon.2.a: "Who would have thought that a former Queen would flee her little island ?"

 dvg_aragon.3.t: "Maria Borgia, Future Duchess of Milan"
 dvg_aragon.3.d: "Maria of Aragon had been promised to the son of Leopoldo I the prince of Legnano in the hopes of uniting peacefully Italy. However the usurpation of Josep Serna ended these hopes with the former queen sent under house arrest in the island of Capri"
 dvg_aragon.3.f: " Despite the betrothal officially broken by the Cortes-General Massimiliano never abandoned his fiancée and planned for her escape. Abord a Genoese ship bought by the Duke Maria fled and finally arrived in Milan where the two were married by the archbishop. While formally accepting her abdication of the crown of Aragon as to not provoke more Serna and upset the status quo the ducal couple has in private swore to retake their Italians possessions from the Catalans who wronged them. Already several legitimist nobles from Naples and Sicily so-called 'Borjists' have come to Milan to meet with their pretender."

  dvg_ari_acceptitalians_desc: "For Centuries now the Crown of Aragon has been a dominant power on the Italian peninsula. But since the Revolutionary Wars the prospect of unifying the North into another Crown ruled by the Kings of Valencia has faded notably because the Italian nationalists have proclaimed us foreigners and imperialists..\n\nJosep Serna will not repeat the mistakes of his forefathers and rule Italy in personal union with Aragon like Sardinia, Sicily, Naples, and the other Crowns. The defunct Imperial Crown of the 12th-century Latin Empire will be the means to forge a new realm of Latins uniting Italy and Aragon under a single Emperor!"
