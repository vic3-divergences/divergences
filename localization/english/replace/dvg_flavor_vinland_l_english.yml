 #Vinland primer
 dvg_vinland.1.t: "Scandinavia's [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]"
 dvg_vinland.1.d: ""
 dvg_vinland.1.f: "Be servants and you will be deservedly scorned but fight to be citizens and you will be rightfully strengthened.・ ・ Emil Krag leader of the Rebellion of 1827\n\nNo colony is as dear to [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetName] as [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]. First briefly settled by the Norse modern [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] settlement began in the early 1600s. [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective]s (many from Norway) and Finns tended to obtain colonial charters for the north Germans and Scots for the south. The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] crown embraced this bifurcation by creating the colonies of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MSG').GetName]. Plantagenia invaded [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName] in 1799 and while they were defeated the traumatic experienced sharpened [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] views that [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetName] was not a reliable protector. The Rebellion of 1827 was sparked due to bitterness about local corruption and lack of representation or self-rule led by the politician Emil Krag. The revolt was crushed but both colonies have been under military occupation ever since. A single spark could light the fire anew."
 dvg_vinland.1.a: "Vinland, we stand on guard for thee!"

 #Masgirland Primer
 dvg_vinland.2.t: "The Crown Colony of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MSG').GetName]"
 dvg_vinland.2.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MSG').GetName], while settled at the same time as [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName] has developed a separate identity mainly due to the difference in its colonization."
 dvg_vinland.2.f: "Unlike [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName] it was mainly settled by the Germans and the Scottish. The situation in [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MSG').GetName] is further complicated due to its economy. Much of the colony is reliant upon fishing and thus upon European export markets. This has led [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MSG').GetAdjective]s to ironically, see themselves as closer to the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] colonial authorities than the mostly Nordic [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]ers who are much more militant about independence and republicanism. While [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MSG').GetName] has its own discontents about lack of representation within [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetName] should [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName] make another bid for freedom[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MSG').GetAdjective]s may struggle to choose a side."
 dvg_vinland.2.b: "The small protected by the Great."

 #Skrealings Primer
 dvg_vinland.3.t: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SKR').GetName]"
 dvg_vinland.3.d: "Nestled in the heart of Arcadia lies an indigenous-led territory."
 dvg_vinland.3.f: "For many European settlers, the Great Lakes is a barbarian region where civilization has yet to spread. For philosophers this is a Garden of Eden where noble savages thrive. For [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetName] this is their most remote colony. For most of the local tribes - the hundreds of Algonquin and Iroquois nations that inhabit the region and who answer to the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] governor - the so-called Skraeling Council allows them to live in relative peace. But as [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]ers ask for independence while the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective]s and [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_CNF').GetAdjective]s  eye the border territories the differences between the Algonquins and the Iroquois are thrown into sharp relief. Europeans may have lumped them together but they are not one people not yet at least. Soon they will once again march to war but will it be against each other or against the settlers?"
 dvg_vinland.3.a: "There's not one big Skraeling tribe?"

 #Olaf Larsson
 dvg_vinland.4.t: "The Rebellion of 1837"
 dvg_vinland.4.d: "Nestled in the heart of Arcadia lies an indigenous-led territory."
 dvg_vinland.4.f: "Olaf Larsson, a [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] fur trader of minor renown has been dissatisfied with the steep [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] tariffs which have greatly cut into his business and has radicalized into a militant republican. Hoping to ignite a popular revolution against [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] rule he and a small group of sympathizers held a meeting in which they declared the ・Vinlandic Republic・ with Larsson as provisional president. This ・Executive Council of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]・ then seized a printing press and began printing announcements of the ・creation of the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] Republic・ and exhorting the people to rise. Larsson and company rode across the area distributing them to whoever they found and goading several mobs to attack [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] patrols. Ultimately however, many people were more amused or confused by their efforts than inspired and the ・Executive Council・ was apprehended by the authorities days after the incident began. However Larsson・s propaganda is still circulating within the colony..."
 dvg_vinland.4.a: "Just another rabble rouser."

 dvg_vinland.5.t: "The Rebellion of 1839"
 dvg_vinland.5.d: "Yet another rebellion has struck [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]."
 dvg_vinland.5.f: "Larsson's rebellion of two years ago was a mere farce, but the radical liberal literature which he distributed has imbued new emotional vibrancy into the VInlandic independence movement. One group which has seen a revival of its fortunes is the Samfunn af Patrioter (Society of Patriots) a secret independence society led by politician Kresten S・ndergaard. A small fight in Erikshavn between the Patrioter and several members of the Leifssonklub cladestine loyalists, soon led to arrest warrants being issued for multiple Patrioter. The Patrioter instead decided to resist arrest soon led to arrest warrants being issued for multiple Patrioter. The Patrioter instead decided to resist arrest summoning hundreds of members into the countryside to protect the fleeing fugitives. After fending off several Scando-Vinlandic search parties and beginning to snowball in strength and numbers the Patrioter militia was finally defeated near the frontier of the Belgian Confederacy. We were surprised to learn that S・ndergaard himself had been leading the rebels! He is now in custody and will soon stand trial for treason and insurrection."
 dvg_vinland.5.a: "We already got a necktie for him."

 dvg_vinland.6.t: "Sondergaard Escapes"
 dvg_vinland.6.d: "Despite the Patrioter's theatrics, the trial was fairly straightforward."
 dvg_vinland.6.f: "The evidence against him was considerable and despite several eloquent speeches from the defendant his guilt fairly obvious. Condemned to death, he was held under armed guard in Elvemunning Prison in Erikshavn` before being transported to the town square for public execution. As the transport was passing beneath a bridge however, a single Patriot dashed into the road and aimed a pistol at the driver ordering him to stop! Simultaneously a large group of Patriot men leapt over a nearby wall rushed the vehicle and forced open the doors. S・ndergaard was quickly freed before the mob dispersed in advance of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] reinforcements. Despite an ongoing manhunt Sondergaard has yet to be found..."
 dvg_vinland.6.a: "Can't [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]ers do anything right?"


 dvg_vinland.7.t: "Martyrdom of Sondergaard"
 dvg_vinland.7.d: "Despite the Patrioter's theatrics, the trial was fairly straightforward."
 dvg_vinland.7.f: "With news of Sondergaard's escape, it was thought that he wouldn・t be able to hide for long. Thus the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] government was frustrated at the lack of the search・s progress ・ until a certain horrid tale reached them. Apparently S・ndergaard had been captured by a patrol near the Belgian border about a week ago. Rather than report his capture the patrol ・ several of whom had family members who were killed by Patrioter in 1827 and 1839 ・ decided to enact their own revenge. For weeks, Sondergaard was tortured in the basement of an abandoned hunting lodge, eventually dying of his wounds. Although the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] governor demanded that this remain secret information has a way of leaking out. A fortnight later the newspaper headlines scream of ・THE AGONY OF SONDERGAARD.・ Slowly, people who read the ghastly tale and had never been all that political before, begin to discover within themselves a love of liberty and a hatred of the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] Crown and the blood-soaked regime that it is propping up..."
 dvg_vinland.7.a: "His soul is marching on!"
 dvg_vinland.7.b: "This fad will go away."


 dvg_vinland.8.t: "Martyrdom of Sondergaard"
 dvg_vinland.8.d: "Despite the Patrioter's theatrics, the trial was fairly straightforward."
 dvg_vinland.8.f: "With news of Sondergaard's escape, it was thought that he wouldn・t be able to hide for long.

 dvg_vinland.8.a: "His soul is marching on!"

 dvg_vinland.9.t: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] Revolution"
 dvg_vinland.9.d: "The recent loss of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] control in Arcadia has breathed new life into the nationalist Samfunn af Patrioter. Reorganized under the leadership of liberal firebrand Johan Nielsson."
 dvg_vinland.9.f: "The Patrioter had formed republican cells in cities across [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName], recruiting members of both the military and the civilian [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] government into their ranks. Each cell then organized a militia to be called upon when the time came. That time came about four days ago when a [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] unit attempted to arrest a Patrioter cell within the Kusbole militia and their comrades came out to defend them. The standoff soon became a battle one which signaled the initiation of a full-scale Patrioter uprising. [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] officers and politicians began defecting to the Patrioters as news of the rebellion spread and with [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetName] unable to contain the rebellion it even spread into [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MSG').GetName]. Both colonies・ capitals have been seized and the banners of liberal democracy lifted high above Arcadia."
 dvg_vinland.9.a: "Frihet likestilling Brorskap!"
 dvg_vinland.9.b: "No, don't leave us alone with the Belgians!"


 dvg_vinland.10.t: "The End of the Dominion?"
 dvg_vinland.10.d: "The recent loss of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] control in Arcadia has breathed new life into the nationalist Samfunn af Patrioter. Reorganized under the leadership of liberal firebrand Johan Nielsson."
 dvg_vinland.10.f: "The recent loss of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] control in Arcadia has breathed new life into the nationalist Samfunn af Patrioter. Reorganized under the leadership of liberal firebrand Johan Nielsson the Patrioter had formed republican cells in cities across [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName] and now a battle between a [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] patrol and a Patrioter militia has stirred them to action. A wave of rebellions swept across the colony and [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] officers and politicians began defecting to the Patrioter as news of the revolt spread. The failure of the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] military to crush the rebellion early allowed it to achieve unprecedented success. Now, cities across [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] Arcadia have been overrun and the revolt has spread into [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MSG').GetName]. As the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] banner is torn down and the banner of liberal democracy raised in its place it appears that our empire has been cast out of Arcadia."
 dvg_vinland.10.a: "How could this have happened?"
 dvg_vinland.10.b: "No, it's not too late! [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName] shall still be [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective]!"

 dvg_vinland.11.t: "A New Development"
 dvg_vinland.11.d: "As [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName] has declared independence, [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MSG').GetName] finds itself at a crossroads."
 dvg_vinland.11.f: "The recent independence of the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] Republic has sent shock waves across Arcadia. We have found ourselves caught up in the rising tide of revolution and as the new political order inflames our own institutions we are drifting into the orbit of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName] more than ever before. For now we have managed to forestall annexation but the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]ers have obtained tremendous influence over us now that we are estranged from [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetName]. Though they assure us that all of our concerns will be addressed at the upcoming constitutional convention many [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MSG').GetAdjective]s are alarmed at the reports of escalating anti-monarchist violence sweeping [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]・particularly news of ominous bladed contraptions being erected in city squares."
 dvg_vinland.11.a: "We have been, and always will be [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] subjects."
 dvg_vinland.11.b: "Obviously [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName] is our brother and we should stay together."

 dvg_vinland.12.t: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] War of Independence"
 dvg_vinland.12.d: "Disapproving of the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] Petition for Independence, [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetName] has made it known they will retake the country by force."
 dvg_vinland.12.f: " To arms [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]ers!  Form your battalions and march! Let an impure blood water our furrows!・ - Dahlborgsangen\n\nAs expected the murderous Stuarts could not tolerate our enlightened republic. They have declared war upon us and soon an army of conquest shall arrive upon our shores to bolster the rats which have nested in Olavsstad. Our glorious Grunnlovens Forsvarar Schoultz is already marshalling the new [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] Revolutionary Army to throw them back into the sea! We shall fall upon them with the Viking fury which burns within the heart of all [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]ers!"
 dvg_vinland.12.a: "Stige [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]!"

 dvg_vinland.13.t: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] War of Independence"
 dvg_vinland.13.d: "Disapproving of the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] Petition for Independence, [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetName] has made it known they will retake the country by force."

 dvg_vinland.13.a: "Stige [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]!"


 dvg_vinland.14.t: "Treaty of Venice"
 dvg_vinland.14.d: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] military has met with a humiliating defeat in the New World."
 dvg_vinland.14.f: "Unable to subdue the insurrectionary colonials we have finally been forced to admit that the war to reconquer [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] Arcadia is lost. A treaty has been signed in Venice in which [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MSG').GetName] have both been granted independence. As bitter recriminations echo throughout the streets of Copenhagen the inferno of revolution burns bright in the West for good or for ill."
 dvg_vinland.14.a: "The West has Fallen."


 dvg_vinland.15.t: "The Lion of the North"
 dvg_vinland.15.d: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] Revolution has been defeated."
 dvg_vinland.15.f: "Victory at last! The mad Schoultz and his murderous legions have been destroyed and [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] Arcadia is back in the hands of the Crown. As our soldiers fan out across the region all the criminals and traitors of the illegitimate ・Republic・ shall be hunted down like the vermin they are. Meanwhile our loyal subjects rejoice in our victory and the restoration of enlightened government across the land. The main question now is what to do with our liberated colonies. Clearly permanent occupation is unworkable. Plans are being drawn up for a more workable solution however conflicting visions in our government have made this process go very slowly. It may take about a month before we can review the final proposals until then we shall merge [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MSG').GetName] into a temporary occupation government."
 dvg_vinland.15.a: "Stige [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]!"

 dvg_vinland.16.t: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] Constitutional Convention"
 dvg_vinland.16.d: "With the newfound independence of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName], the first order of business is to establish exactly what legal foundation the country shall rest upon."
 dvg_vinland.16.f: "Though the nation・s status as a republic has been confirmed. many aspects of its laws are still up in the air. Many delegates seem to be separating out into four political camps : the liberals, the conservatives, the reactionaries, and the radicals. The group that manages to sway most of the convention to its side will gain tremendous power to shape the destiny of the new nation. ｧRIf a particularly extreme faction manages to come out on top, however, the resulting instability could topple the republic?"
 dvg_vinland.16.a: "Stige [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]!"

 dvg_vinland.17.t: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] Constitutional Convention"
 dvg_vinland.17.d: "With the newfound independence of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName], the first order of business is to establish exactly what legal foundation the country shall rest upon."

 dvg_vinland.17.a: "Let us forge a strong foundation for our future!"

 dvg_vinland.18.t: "The Question of the Voting System"
 dvg_vinland.18.d: "The first major question to arise during debate was what form the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] voting system should adopt."
 dvg_vinland.18.f: "Conservatives, fearful of a ・mobocracy,・ have stressed that only landowning men have the personal responsibility and resources to be trusted with the vote. Liberals scoffed at such ・feudal・ ideas but believed that there still should be certain qualifications based on wealth. Radicals aghast at the mere suggestion of voting restrictions demanded nothing less than universal male suffrage arguing that democratic representation is the issue which drove [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName] to seek independence in the first place and that it would be both unethical and hypocritical to deny it to its citizens in turn. The convention eventually chose..."
 dvg_vinland.18.a: "Land-based Franchise"
 dvg_vinland.18.b: "Wealth-qualified Franchise!"
 dvg_vinland.18.c: "Universal Franchise!"

 dvg_vinland.19.t: "The Question of Native Enfranchisement"
 dvg_vinland.19.d: "The next issue to arise during debate was whether to extend the franchise to indigenous [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]ers."
 dvg_vinland.19.f: "The topic sparked sharp debate and inspired some rather acidic remarks from the less cosmopolitan delegates. The conservatives deployed manifold arguments against native suffrage, from racial science theories to denigration of the natives・ moral character to disputing the citizenship of non-European [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]ers and all sorts of other defenses against the idea. On this topic, however, the liberals and radicals closed ranks. [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName], unlike other Euro-Arcadian nations, has always seen closer racial integration between European and native peoples. Native [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]ers the liberals and radicals reminded the conservatives fought in the Great Arcadian War against the Plantagenians, buoyed the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] economy for centuries, and were the ancestors of ・many delegates in this room.・ To deny them suffrage they argued, would be an insult to history and the very essence of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]. The convention eventually chose..."
 dvg_vinland.19.a: "Extend to all European-descended men."
 dvg_vinland.19.b: "To disregard race and ethnic heritage."


 dvg_vinland.20.t: "The Question of Native Land Rights"
 dvg_vinland.20.d: "The next issue to arise during debate was how to address indigenous lands within [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]."
 dvg_vinland.20.f: "Due to the complex ethnic makeup of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName], the topic has many implications for [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName]・s economic and societal future. The conservatives conceded that the natives should be able to petition the government for their lands but urged that this be qualified by guarantees that said natives would seek to better themselves and their lands bringing both up to ・civilized・ standards. Liberals denounced the conservatives for ・demanding that natives navigate legal mazes to secure their own homes,・ and proposed to create a commission to review and process native land claims. Radicals, however, astonished even the liberals by demanding that native lands be placed under special jurisdiction to weigh elections in natives・ favor and even allow native councils to pass ordinances to restrict or bar Europeans from entering! The convention eventually chose..."
 dvg_vinland.20.a: "Voluntary land reclamation."
 dvg_vinland.20.b: "A commission to adjudicate native land claims"
 dvg_vinland.20.c: "Extensive native rights' measures in."

 dvg_vinland.21.t: "The Question of Head of State"
 dvg_vinland.21.d: "The last issue to arise during debate was what powers the head of state should receive. "
 dvg_vinland.21.f: "This was a contentious issue, as the role of the head of state is intimately connected to the form of the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] government writ large. The conservatives came out swinging, declaring that the only way to prevent [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName] from sliding back into chaos was to establish a centralized government with a strong President to unify the nation and provide consistent leadership. The radicals led the charge against such plans denouncing them as ・Caesarism-in-waiting.・ They instead urged the convention to embrace a federal model with a purely ceremonial head of state denouncing them as ・Caesarism-in-waiting.・ They instead urged the convention to embrace a federal model with a purely ceremonial head of state to keep power diffused across the government rather than concentrated in one place. The debate seemed to have split the liberals and supporters for both proposals could be found on both sides though a plurality of them favored the federal option. The convention eventually chose."
 dvg_vinland.21.a: "A powerful, effective president."
 dvg_vinland.21.b: "A ceremonial president."

 dvg_vinland.22.t: "Masgirland Petitions for Annexation"
 dvg_vinland.22.d: "Realizing they might not survive on their own economically or militarily, Masgirland petitions to join our country. "

 dvg_vinland.24.t: "Seize the Mantle of Arcadia?"
 dvg_vinland.24.d: "As it stands, pan-Arcadian ideals have yet to materalize, providing a possible opportunity for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. "
 dvg_vinland.24.f: " Our continent is in chaos as both Belgium and Plantagenia have turned inwards and spurned attempts at pan-Arcadian unity. Even we must recognize that an Arcadia forever divided will be torn apart by the interests of foreign empires. We need a radical solution to save the future of our continent. A new nation must come forth not born out of pining for lost empires or bellicose rhetoric of hatred but one conceived in the fullness of liberty - a liberty for ALL peoples whatever their race whatever their creed. VInland is the last hope of Arcadia the last hope to right her ancient wrongs and wash away her sins."
 dvg_vinland.24.a: "It is our destiny!"
 dvg_vinland.24.b: "We are NOT joining the pan-Arcadia bandwagon."

 dvg_vinland.25.t: "A Different Arcadian Dream"
 dvg_vinland.25.d: "As varying powers had their own ambitions for Arcadia, what was realized by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was a compromise of all of them and went even further."
 dvg_vinland.25.f: "The Belgians spoke of the ・Arcadian Dream・ as some sort of mandate to conquer the west while the Plantagenians pined for their lost empire. Both concepts were dismissed by Vinlanders as madness and folly but they were founded on a noble ideal : the integration and unity of the continent. It fell to us to divine the true path to bring ALL Arcadians regardless of color or creed into one family. Our economies and our political structures have now merged into one : we can no longer discern where one ends and another begins. We must all take the final step and create an unbreakable and perpetual union founded on principles of equality, justice, and common dignity. Now and forever we shall be the Arcadian Union! Thy magic binds again what custom strictly divided : All people become brothers where thy gentle wing abides!"
 dvg_vinland.25.a: "Enhed!" 


 dvg_vinland.26.t: "The Inevitable Unification of Arcadia"
 dvg_vinland.26.d: "The balance of power on the Arcadian continent seems well on its way to becoming lopsided."
 dvg_vinland.26.f: " Belgium and Plantagenia・s latest titanic clash has caused the victor to seek to force the defeated to unify with their own nation. If this occurs then they will upend the Arcadian balance of power ・ their prospective population alone will make any future war against them all but unwinnable. Yet now they are vulnerable and they currently hold former Skr・ling lands which rightfully belong to us. Now is our last chance to demand the Great Lakes basin in its entirety! If they refuse then force will be our only other option."
 dvg_vinland.26.a: "We can't lose those lands forever!" 
 dvg_vinland.26.b: "This isn't an issue worth fighting over." 


 dvg_vinland.27.t: "The Inevitable Unification of Arcadia"
 dvg_vinland.27.d: "The balance of power on the Arcadian continent seems well on its way to becoming lopsided."
 dvg_vinland.27.f: "Belgium and Plantagenia・s latest titanic clash has caused the victor to seek to force the defeated to unify with their own nation. If this occurs then they will upend the Arcadian balance of power ・ and quite possibly turn their gaze towards our eastern frontier. Yet now they are vulnerable and our eastern garrisons hold a commanding position. Now is our last chance to demand an officially demarcated eastern frontier and to force any future Arcadian state to forswear further western expansion! If they refuse then force will be our only other option..."
 dvg_vinland.27.a: "We must preserve our eastern frontier!"
 dvg_vinland.27.b: "Nah"



 #Skraelingr
 dvg_skraeling.1.t: "A Meeting of the National Council"
 dvg_skraeling.1.d: "The National Council of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was formed to allow all of the major tribes within our lands to have representation but it is widely criticized. "
 dvg_skraeling.1.f: "Presided over by a [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] representative the Council's actual legislative abilities are few. Moreover, the process by which tribes are allotted representatives is frequently revised by Copenhagen and several tribes which are large enough to merit increased representation simply are left out for political reasons. Worst of all the Iroquois continue to be overrepresented within the Council reflecting their status as the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective]・s primary collaborator. All of this means that the Council often struggles to even make it through its day-to-day business reflecting their status as the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective]s' primary collaborator. All of this means that the Council often struggles to even make it through its day-to-day business let alone address crises. The worst part is that it is one of the most democratic and native-supporting systems in Euro-Arcadian society the bar is just that low."

 dvg_skraeling.2.f: "Ever since the Dual Monarchy pushed its colonial boundaries into the Arcadian hinterland in the 17th century Catholic missionaries have been a recurring sight across the Misizipi and Ohio river valleys. Now Plantagenia has sent the Society of Jesus or simply the Jesuits to assist us in educating our people. The Jesuits are known for integrating into a target community to better evangelize them seeking both to convert non-Christians and bring non-Catholics into the Roman fold. This along with their insular nature, leads many to heap accusations of conspiracy against them. Though most of these are too wild to take seriously a concerning number of southern Illimarkers have accepted Catholicism much to the dismay of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] Protestant missionaries. ｧRWhile they are strengthening our literacy they might also lead to cultural divergence and even separatism amongst the southerners..."

 dvg_skraeling.3.f: "Various Christian sects have long intermingled with native faiths but so far the resulting syncretic beliefs have remained local idiosyncrasies. A new religious movement amonge the Kattefolket of the southeast may change this. The believers have been called the ・Sikariere・ after the Jewish religious militants of ancient times who sought to drive the Romans from their lands. Their leader Tarhe (also known as ・The Great Crane・) fancies himself a religious prophet. Inspired by a series of visions which he claims to have received last year he has begun preaching a strange faith which blends elements of Protestant Christianity with beliefs from many different Iroquoian tribes. The main tenets of ・Sikarierism・ are temperance community solidarity and rejection of European culture. He has begun to attract quite a following much to the alarm of the Europeans amongst us..."
 dvg_skraeling.3.a: "Nothing to worry about."
 dvg_skraeling.3.b: "He needs to go preach somewhere else."

 dvg_skraeling.4.t: "Decline of the Fur Trade"
 dvg_skraeling.4.d: "Various Christian sects have long intermingled with native faiths but so far the resulting syncretic beliefs have remained local idiosyncrasies."
 dvg_skraeling.4.f: "The fur trade has always been a cornerstone of the native Arcadian economy. The arrival of the Europeans however,  turned it into a massive enterprise which drove unprecedented levels of conflict amongst the tribes to supply the lucrative European market. The Iroquois became particularly known for their bellicose attitude towards their rivals in the fur trade. Yet, the trade has suffered from overhunting as well as the growth of other fur sources in Hokkaigan, Qingqiu, and eastern Europe. A group of Iroquois tribes are now planning to press the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] authorities to recognize them as the official representatives of fur traders within the Territory. They cite not only their tribe・s long history as the preeminent fur traders in the region but the efficiency of routing the trade through only one group. While this would be highly lucrative it would also outrage the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] traders not to mention all of the non-Iroquois tribes."

 dvg_skraeling.5.d: "Various Christian sects have long intermingled with native faiths but so far the resulting syncretic beliefs have remained local idiosyncrasies."
 dvg_skraeling.5.f: "A recent book has brought the culture of the Kanien'k・ha (Mohawk) people to Belgian attention. Henrik Costeau・s ・On the Mohawk Tribes and their Government・ is the result of three years of research with Costeau having traveled throughout the northeastern Skr・ling Territory to compile his information. The work is a shameless courting of public scandal and infamy with Costeau making many exaggerations and distortions of Kanien'k・ha culture in the name of luridness (particularly his illustrations of Kanien'k・ha women). The worst part of it all is that even with such unprofessional presentation the work still represents an expansion of Euro-Arcadian knowledge of the Kanien'k・ha and of the Skr・ling Territory in general."

 dvg_skraeling.6.d: "As calls for liberty grow in Vinland, the existence of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] might be under threat."
 dvg_skraeling.6.f: "The reports from the north are clear : the Crown Colony of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetName] has ceased to exist. In its place a new and independent [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] state has arisen and [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetName]・s influence in Arcadia has evaporated. Unfortunately, our ・nation・ was largely a [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] construction and our government and infrastructure are severely underdeveloped. Now, many tribes are agitating for independence and the entire Great Lakes region risks dissolving into factionalism and separatism. With swift and decisive action from the government (such as it is) we might be able to hold things together, at least for the short term. But how should we couch our rhetoric to keep the nation together? Should we focus on dissuading radicalism and awaiting further developments?"

 dvg_skraeling.7.f: "The end of the Sanacomie War threatens to drive both the Belgian Confederacy and Plantagenia to turn towards the Skraeling lands now that they are no longer preoccupied with fighting one another. The autonomous status of the Skraeling puts them in danger but they have hitherto strongly resisted integration owing to fears of becoming just another colony. The liberal [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] regime has instilled a newfound level of cautious trust among leading Skr・ling officials and influential chiefs.

 dvg_skraeling.9.f: "After round after round of discussions between [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] officials and tribal authorities it has been decided that the Skr・ling Territory concept proved unworkable. A wholly artificial [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] construct from the very beginning there was no way to maintain it within our nation while ensuring full representation to all the tribes. Therefore the entire system has been eliminated and replaced with federal territories adjusted for each major tribal group involved. Rather than vesting power in this or that group over another the federal territories will allow each community to protect its culture within our national framework. This will of course only be extended to the ex-Skr・ling tribes."
 dvg_skraeling.9.a: "Another borken system replaced by enlightenment." 

 dvg_skraeling.10.t: "The Great Skraeling Revolt"
 dvg_skraeling.10.d: "Various Christian sects have long intermingled with native faiths but so far the resulting syncretic beliefs have remained local idiosyncrasies."
 dvg_skraeling.10.f: "When we announced the incorporation of the Skraeling lands, we expected resistance from the natives but nothing too substantial ・ after all the Territory is an artificial construct barely holding itself together with no cultural foundation to unify it. It seems that our judgment was incorrect. A charismatic native preacher named Tarhe has led the growth of a syncretic faith incorporating Christian, Iroquois, and Algonquin religious elements ・ and he has not taken our actions lying down. His ・Sikariere・ as the believers are known have taken up arms against us. Many natives who are not particularly zealous have still flocked to the movement seeing it as the main form of resistance to our rule. Now the Sikariere have overrun the Skr・ling government and declared full independence!"
 dvg_skraeling.10.a: "This revolt must be destroyed!"

 dvg_skraeling.11.d: "In a surprising upset, the Great Crane has managed to defeat [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] forces."
 dvg_skraeling.11.f: "The holy book of the Christians tells that the two greatest prophets were Moses and Jesus - one who came to rescue his people and the other to redeem all people. The faith and traditions of the native peoples tell of many heroes and sages of their own. But one has now risen above all others : the Prophet Tarhe Praised Be His Holy Name! The Great Crane has led our crusade to victory over the infidels. As our sacred hosts of holy warriors sweep across the north all our indigenous kindred are being liberated from their servitude and restored to their old lands. Righteous vengeance shall be inflicted upon all the decadent cities of the east and all false idols cast down. Across the world heretic and heathen alike are confounded and astonished by our triumph. Let the pillars of Hell tremble for the Kingdom of Heaven upon Earth is soon to come!"

 dvg_skraeling.12.f: "There was an idea created in Copenhagen but born out in Arcadia : an idea of the Skraeling of the Great Lakes and all of their tribes brought together within a single government. That notion ・ that political reality ・ has been murdered. It has perished on a dozen battlefields it has burned with a hundred villages it has slipped into the sky from a thousand wailing mournful cries of mothers, daughters,  and sisters who shall never see their sons, fathers, and brothers again. The Vinlandic government has broken up all major native communities forcing them to congregate in a small area known simply as the Consolidated Lands. All the rest of their domain has been placed in the trust of the Vinlandic administration to be sold off or allotted as they see fit. Tens of thousands of natives are being driven from their homes never to return. Many will not even reach the Consolidated Lands. The emaciated, diseased, and despairing survivors shall be the last of the Skraeling"

 dvg_skraeling.13.d: "As we have gained independence, the question remains on how we shall be governed."
 dvg_skraeling.13.f: "The end of foreign rule has opened the floodgates of political discourse across our nation and the matter has reached the National Council itself. The only thing that most citizens can agree on is that we must embrace some sort of unifying policy to prevent total dissolution. It is tempting to take this opportunity to curtail all foreign influences and focus on internal development forming an alliance of tribes without radical reform. This might leave us vulnerable, however, which is why others advocate a modernized, confederal system guided by a strong head of state and a more engaging foreign policy. The Sikariere on the council have made their own recommendations for a theocratic regime and strange as it may sound they have accumulated a noteworthy following amongst the people. Where shall the future of the Skraeling lie?"
 dvg_skraeling.13.a: "Tradition and Unity will keep us safe."

 dvg_skraeling.14.d: "In a surprising upset, the Great Crane has managed to defeat [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] forces."
 dvg_skraeling.14.f: "We had allowed the Jesuits into our nation in good faith on the grounds of giving both Protestant and Catholic missionaries equal treatment. That trust has now been violated by the machinations of Plantagenia. A revolt has now been organized in the southwest in which the tribes of the region ・ who have largely converted to Catholicism ・ have requested Plantagenian ・protection!・ We cannot be certain of how many Jesuits were in on the scheme or whether they orchestrated it voluntarily or were intimidated by the Plantagenians but that doesn・t matter right now. As of this moment all authority in the southwest has collapsed."
 dvg_skraeling.14.a: "This is treason!"


 dvg_skraeling.15.t: "The Four Fires Council"
 dvg_skraeling.15.d: "In a completely unexpected turn of events, the major tribes of the southwestern Skr・ling have declared independence under the banner of the Four Fires Council."
 dvg_skraeling.15.f: "In a completely unexpected turn of events, the major tribes of the southwestern Skr・ling have declared independence under the banner of the Four Fires Council. It just so happens that many of them have converted to Catholicism under the influence of the Jesuits amongst them. As we all know the Indians of the Great Lakes are heathen savages so it wouldn・t be right to leave fellow Catholics to their mercy. The only humane thing to do is to take them under our wing and ・protect・ them. A Plantagenian military detachment has already departed for their capital to・arrange the terms of this protection."
 dvg_skraeling.15.a: "It's for their own good."

 dvg_skraeling.16.d: "In a surprising upset, the Great Crane has managed to defeat [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] forces."
 dvg_skraeling.16.f: "Our government has struggled to hold itself together since we were thrust into independence. Now even that desperate endeavor has ended. News of Belgian forces crossing the eastern border ignited an inextinguishable blaze of chaos across our lands. Various tribes have declared independence or even sought protection from Vinland to save themselves from the wrath of the Belgians. Our nation has crumbled before our very eyes. Nobody can say what the future of the Great Lakes will be but it is now obvious that the Skraeling as a united people will not play a part in it."

 dvg_skraeling.17.d: "In a surprising upset, the Great Crane has managed to defeat [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] forces."
 dvg_skraeling.17.f: "The collapse of the Skraeling nation has caused the Iroquois formerly the most economically influential component of the Skraeling to return to independence. However they hold lands which both our nation and our neighbor have long coveted. They have expressed no interest in arranging a formal division of the Iroquois territory. Thus we are now competing for whomever can compel the Iroquois to capitulate first. To the victor goes the Iroquois nation."

 dvg_skraeling.18.f: " the Belgians have coveted the notion of westward expansion into the Skr・ling lands. Now that the natives are vulnerable they have seized the opportunity to strike. Judging by their rhetoric, they seem set on conquering as much of the Skraeling as they can. Therefore, we have only a limited window of opportunity to act or else lose them forever to the Belgians. Some see the entirety of the Great Lakes as our own natural frontier and want us to demand an immediate end to the Belgian invasion threatening war if they refuse. Others believe that the Belgians could be made to negotiate and agree on a division of the lands with us. A few determined pacifists simply do not want to get involved. How shall we proceed?"
 dvg_skraeling.18.a: "Send the ultimatum and ready the troops."

 dvg_skraeling.19.f: "Our efforts to subdue the western Indians have not gone unnoticed in Erikshavn. Vinland has presented an ultimatum : End our current war immediately or else they shall intervene on the side of the Skraeling. While it is unclear if they possess the military might to enforce such a threat few members of our government relish the thought of a two-front war. Unfortunately we do not have the luxury of time to mull over our response : the Vinlanders demand an immediate reply. What shall we answer?"
 dvg_skraeling.19.a: "We'll see you on the battlefield.."

 dvg_skraeling.20.f: "Our efforts to subdue the western Indians have not gone unnoticed in Erikshavn. The Vinlanders have approached us in private to offer an arrangement regarding the Great Lakes. Under the terms of the proposed secret treaty our two nations would partition the Skraeling roughly in half along a north-south line with Vinland keeping the north and ourselves the south. The resulting borders seem fair and our military must have made an impression on the Vinlanders for them to offer a division of the Indian lands rather than seek to keep us out of them entirely. Still, we are under no obligations to accept but they may declare war if we refuse.."

A new law is now being voted on by the National Council. If passed then we shall formally petition Vinland for annexation.

The believers have been called the ・Sikariere・ after the Jewish religious militants of ancient times who sought to drive the Romans from their lands. Their leader Tarhe (also known as ・The Great Crane・) fancies himself a religious prophet. Inspired by a series of visions which he claims to have received last year he has begun preaching a strange faith which blends elements of Protestant Christianity with beliefs from many different Iroquoian tribes.

 #concept_Emil Krag: "Emil Krag was a half-Vinlandic author and political activist who led the Revolution of 1827 against the #[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VIN').GetAdjective] colonial government and its [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] overlords. While unsuccessful he has become a martyr both for liberals and for native Arcadians. Krag is seen by some as the manifestation of the liberal ideal someone who walked in both the European and the native Arcadian cultural worlds without totally immersing himself within either.
