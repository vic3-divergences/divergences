 je_one_kongsi: "One [concept_dod_kongsi]!"
 je_one_kongsi_reason: "The Country, Long Divided, Must Unite. Tensions between Mianjin and Yaluo have grown great, and mediation between the two has resulted in failure. The time has come for war, and of this war, there may be no winners, for brother will be against brother, and family against family once more."
 je_one_kongsi_goal: "Our relationship with the another, neighboring Zhourao polity is amicable enough that we can work towards uniting together as a nation."
 je_yaluo_reform: "Anger of Conservative Hui"
 je_yaluo_reform_reason: "The turn to democracy in [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_yaluo').GetName], away from the tyrannical oligarchy of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_mianjin').GetName], might have been expected to be received universally well, however, those in the northern hui of [SCOPE.sState('scope_xinxiang').GetName] are far more close to their relatives across the border. Too much reform could lead them to rejoin [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_mianjin').GetName] and break free."
 je_yaluo_reform_goal: "Anger of Conservative Hui"
 je_invade_zhusha: "Invade Zhusha!"
 je_invade_zhusha_reason: "Our northern brothers, whilst culturally different, worshipping a different religion, are still [concept_dod_zhourao]. We must unify the Eastern Continent, unleashing a storm upon the North."
 je_red_sultan: "Balance of Princely Power"
 je_red_sultan_reason: "The current sultan is old, and his sons, Ma Lushou, and Ma Luoxi already bite at eachothers throats, however, while Ma Zicheng still rules, their schemes are far more limited. Once the Red Sultan is out of the picture; chaos might very well overwhelm the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], should a successor not emerge as dominant. #blue At the left of the scale, Lushou has full power, where as at the right of the scale, Luoxi has full power.#!"
 je_red_prince: "Red Prince's War"
 je_red_prince_reason: "Ma Zicheng has collapsed! The chaos that has resulted leaves the two princes in bitter conflict, now unrestrained by their father, they both look to their allies, both abroad and at home, to take charge of the nation, lest it be lead into chaos by their brother!"
 je_zhr_press_west: "The Continent of [concept_dod_zhourao]"
 je_zhr_press_west_reason: "Our nation is at risk. Even with the unification of [concept_dod_zhourao], a sizable portion of the continent is still occupied by outside powers. We need to consolidate our control over the entire continent, including the East should any of it fall to invasion."
 je_zhr_papua: "Annex Papua"
 je_zhr_papua_reason: "Papua is without doubt part of our natural borders, we should look to establish control over it."
 je_zhrzsa_indonesia_first_step: "The First Step"
 je_zhrzsa_indonesia_first_step_reason: "The citizens of Islam in Nusantra are oppressed heavily by the whip of European masters. Now that we have freed our own island, we should look to eliminating the European presence in the region. The first step should be the Moluccas, the Sunda Islands, and Celebes. Of course, our control will be much more benevolent."
 je_zhrzsa_indonesia_java: "Conquest of Java"
 je_zhrzsa_indonesia_java_reason: "With a path into Nusantra established, we should look now to take control over Java, the most populous island in the region. It has been under control of the [concept_dod_voc], and their abuses of power and discrimination against the muslim inhabitants of the island cannot be allowed to continue."
 je_zhrzsa_indonesia_borneo: "Conquest of Borneo"
 je_zhrzsa_indonesia_borneo_reason: "Borneo is an important island in Nusantra, and importantly, has a large population of muslims who would welcome our conquest of the region."
 je_zhrzsa_indonesia_sumatra: "Conquest of Sumatra"
 je_zhrzsa_indonesia_sumatra_reason: "Sumatra is far from [concept_dod_zhourao], but with our bases in the rest of Nusantra, should not be hard to capture."
 je_zhrzsa_indonesia_final_step: "The Final Step"
 je_zhrzsa_indonesia_final_step_reason: "Now that most of Nusantra has been conquered, we should look to the islamic populations of Mindanao and Malaya."
 
 
 je_zhourao_destiny: "Zhourao the Continent"
 je_zhourao_destiny_desc: "For centuries, we were unable to expand west due to our political infighting. Meanwhile the Western barbarians seized the opportunity and colonized the western coast for their own exploitation. Our people discovered this continent before they did, and it is time to claim what is rightfully ours."

#idk where these are actually used, but its causing errors if we dont give them loc
 je_zhourao_truce: "The Denpasar Accords"
 je_zhourao_truce_reason: "The Denpasar Accords stipulates that Burgundy, Scandinavia and the Dual Monarchy will not carve up the continent of Zhourao - known as Chougie to them. Whilst they say that it's to save lives and respect for our sovereignty, it's far more likely that it was signed to prevent war between them..."
 je_zhourao_truce_potential_tt: "The Denpasar Accords have been signed"
 je_pillager_prince_zhourao: "The Pillager Prince"
 je_pillager_prince_zhourao_reason: "The Pillager Prince is a scourge upon the continent, running amok in the countryside and causing issues amongst our lowly! He must be dealt with!"
 pillager_prince_zhourao_tt: "The Pillager Prince no longer lives within our borders"

 #je_frontier_wars: "The Frontier Wars"
 #je_frontier_wars_reason: "Our recent renegation of our promises with the Hongshan tribes has led to those that were previously working with us turning against us. They have begun actively resisting our rule in the west, and are seeking the complete removal of our influence from the area!"

 je_xijiao_takoever: "Harmonious Resurrection"

 je_xijiao_takoever_reason: "Although the followers of [concept_dod_xijiao] were persecuted back in China, they now have infiltrated churches in Mianjin with their teachings. Should they have enough influence, their denmoination may end up as the dominant one in our country"
 
 je_mianjin_oligarchy: "The Kongsi on a Hill"
 je_mianjin_oligarchy_reason: " The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_mianjin').GetName] Kongsi has long justified its rule through its charitable efforts and international connections, yet the imbalance of power and social hierarchy have brought many to question its rule. Already, [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_yaluo').GetName] has seceded and if [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_mianjin').GetName] can't improve the living standards of its populace, the whole country may very well just merge with their bretheren to the south."
 
 je_mianjin_oligarchy_goal: "Mianjin has maintained the following conditions long enough."

 je_changyun: "Outpost of Civilization"
 je_changyun_reason: "As our people settle the islands of the Pacific and talks of the Zhourao continent uniting are prevailing, maybe we can establish our civilization project here in Oceania."

 dvg_zhourao.1.t: "The Yaluo League"
 dvg_zhourao.1.d: "Yaluo is the youngest [concept_dod_zhourao] state, with a recent origin after the First [concept_dod_kongsi] war, wherein Yaluo fought for its independence and won. thanks to a coalition of peasant secret societies democratic mining communities and Hongshan tribes has formed the basis of the new League based on democratic ideals of liberty and equality..."
 dvg_zhourao.1.f: " This has led to a relative period of peace in [concept_dod_zhourao], with the various powers interested in the area mostly agreeing to stay away from the continent.  This has led to a relative period of peace in Zhourao with the various powers interested in the area mostly agreeing to stay away from the continent. However, growing tensions between [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MJN').GetName] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] might very well break the peace in the coming decade. Already, there is rumour that conservative and reactionary interests within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] may defect back to [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MJN').GetName]..."
 dvg_zhourao.1.a: ""The key to success is action, and in action, it is necessary to persevere.""
 dvg_zhourao.2.t: "The Zongting"
 dvg_zhourao.2.d: "The Zongting, or Assembly Hall, is the parliament body of Yaluo. It is made up of delegates from our constituent Hui, whose members are mostly descended from original colonists from Qingqiu. They are unelected, and in recent times, the issue of membership lists in the Hui has come into debate. There are those who would open up the memberships greatly, even including some [concept_dod_hongshan] amongst the lists, and others who would give membership only to those who fought for our independence."
 dvg_zhourao.2.f: "Qingqiu originally colonized the area that would become [concept_dod_zhourao], but the population of Qingqiu settlers was quickly outgrown by Chinese immigration."
 dvg_zhourao.2.a: "Maintain the status quo"
 dvg_zhourao.2.b: "Give membership to those who fought alongside us!"
 dvg_zhourao.2.l: "Open the membership lists to all working men!"

 dvg_zhourao.3.t: "[concept_dod_hongshan] Tribute"
 dvg_zhourao.3.d: " The issue has been brought up of how much should be paid to the  [concept_dod_hongshan] for their role in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s independence. "
 dvg_zhourao.3.f: "During the [concept_dod_kongsi] War, the Zongting sought allies amongst the [concept_dod_hongshan] tribes spread throughout the interior. Many signed treaties of friendship with our people, fighting beside us against the oppressors in Wheizhou. Their support was not unconditional : The tribes were told that after the war they would receive their fair share of tribute from our gold mines. Now, with independence secured, the [concept_dod_hongshan] are calling in the debt. A delegation of tribal chiefs from the Guli confederation have arrived in Qingshui requesting that the Zongting formally grant them a share of the gold profits from our mines. While some Hui have already been doing this, many of the Hui in the northeast have been refusing to pay them the promised tribute. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that since independence many lucrative mines and settlements have been established in the interior of Yaluo on traditional Hongshan land, with the tribesmen consenting on the basis that they would be given an equivalent of their share of the wealth" \n\n The [concept_dod_hongshan] are still reviled as Hongshanman in our northern provinces, often getting into disputes over land, who say the [concept_dod_hongshan] role is marginal, as they have never had the means to establish a proper infrastructure and technology that the Hui have brought over."
 dvg_zhourao.3.a: "We owe nothing to these barbarians, prepare to crush them!"
 dvg_zhourao.3.b: "We can pay them a part of our treasury to appease both sides."
 dvg_zhourao.3.l: "We will force the northern Hui to pay tribute!"

 dvg_zhourao.4.t: "Scandinavia Wants to Operate Businesses in Yaluo"
 dvg_zhourao.4.d: "The Zongting has received an intriguing offer from a consortium of Scandinavian businesses interested in operating inside the territory of Yaluo. Arriving in Qingshui, they have presented plans to build factories in the capital and connect our mining settlements in the interior via railroad. These men claim that Yaluo will benefit from their investment, and there may be some truth to that : opening up to the West may bring us a measure of wealth and help our efforts to modernize. Yet some in the Zongting have reacted angrily to the proposal. Many more conservative delegates worry that Scandinavia, which already has a presence on the island of Vargø to the south, may seek to supplant the Kongsi and establish a colony on mainland Zhourao. They see Western investment as the first step towards colonial subjugation. In response, some delegates have proposed a compromise in which the Scandinavians could establish themselves in our port cities, but not the interior of the country"
 dvg_zhourao.4.f: "We should not provide the enemy an opportunity to defeat us, we have seen how the Scandinavians have operated elsewhere, and this is but the first step in their process."
 dvg_zhourao.4.a: "We will have no intervention by the West in [concept_dod_zhourao]!"
 dvg_zhourao.4.b: "We will allow them a presence in our ports, nothing more."
 dvg_zhourao.4.c: "We are open to investment!"
 dvg_zhourao.5.t: "One [concept_dod_kongsi]"
 dvg_zhourao.5.d: "The time has come in [concept_dod_zhourao], the reforms of Yaluo in recent years have put them on a different course from Mianjin, and as the two [concept_dod_kongsi] expand west, tensions are on the rise. A second [concept_dod_kongsi] war is on the cards."
 dvg_zhourao.5.f: "Who will be the leader, where will be the capital, and how will this new nation be governed is still a matter of contention..."
 dvg_zhourao.5.a: " [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] shall be the sole uniter of [concept_dod_zhourao]!  "
 dvg_zhourao.5.b: " The polities of [concept_dod_zhourao] as a mutual agreement."

 dvg_zhourao.6.t: "The Northern Hui Defect!"
 dvg_zhourao.6.d: "Dissatisfied with the reforms implemented by the Zongting, the more conservative Huis in the north have defected back to Mianjin!"
 dvg_zhourao.6.f: " "We will not accomodate a government that accomodates the people who have no respect for our culture, who did not build our cities, and instead punish those who did..." - A Xinxiang Hui was quoted as saying. "
 dvg_zhourao.6.a: "Oh dear..."
 dvg_zhourao.6.b: "Join the revolt!"
 dvg_event_effects_zhourao.6_tt: "If we are headed towards war with [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_mianjin').GetName], there will be an exodus of conservative Hui. If [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('scope_gentry').GetName] are powerful enough in [SCOPE.sState('scope_xinxiang').GetName], the state might even defect. Otherwise, the state will declare independence."


 dvg_zhourao.7.t: "Militia Mobilize!"
 dvg_zhourao.7.d: "While the Northeastern Hui have abandoned us, the people have not! All across Yaluo, a surging tide of workingmen have taken up arms in defense of the League. Our reforms, which the nay-sayers insisted would weaken our unity, have convinced every man in Yaluo that the League is worth fighting and dying for. In Qingshui, thousands of men have come forward to enlist, some fresh off the boat from China. They are joined by a handful of European's adamant to prove their loyalty. The [concept_dod_hongshan] tribes mobilize in the interior. In every town and settlement, the Hui have called upon every man on the lists. As one, Yaluo marches to war"
 dvg_zhourao.7.f: ""We swear by the League to stand truly by each other, and fight to defend our rights and liberties." - Yaluo militiamen's oath"
 dvg_zhourao.7.a: "Unity is strength!"
 dvg_zhourao.8.t: "Tensions in the North Ease Over"
 dvg_zhourao.8.d: "With the scope of our reforms not distancing ourselves too far from Mianjin, the conservative Huis have for the most part fallen in line"
 dvg_zhourao.8.f: "A good situation"
 dvg_zhourao.8.a: "A good sign, we can focus on the war with Mianjin"
 dvg_event_effects_zhourao.8_tt: "We will no longer need to fear secession in the north"

 dvg_zhourao.9.t: "Yaluo Petitions us for our Annexation!"
 dvg_zhourao.9.d: "We have long had a beneficial relationship with Yaluo, the time has come that Yaluo is asking us to unify."
 dvg_zhourao.9.f: "As it should be."
 dvg_zhourao.9.a: "We refuse! We will make war on them instead!"
 dvg_zhourao.9.b: "We will join our brothers!"
 dvg_zhourao.10.t: "One [concept_dod_kongsi] in [concept_dod_zhourao]"
 dvg_zhourao.10.d: "With the unification of Mianjin and Yaluo, the time for a unified and strong [concept_dod_zhourao] has come. We should look next to our north, attack the Red Sultans, and bring the Zhouraohui under our dominion, as they have so often tried to bring us under theirs."
 dvg_zhourao.10.d1: "With the unification of all of [concept_dod_zhourao] under the flag of Zhusha, the time has come to push out the European settlers to our west, and conquer the entirety of the continent.."
 dvg_zhourao.10.f: "Unification, then stability, a nation must be formed of a heap of loose sand."
 dvg_zhourao.10.a: "We shall be strong as we are and this day will be remembered!"
 dvg_zhourao.10.a1: "Allah has ordained!"
 dvg_zhourao.10.c: "Let's invite the remaining Zhourao countries into our union."
 dvg_zhourao.11.t: "The Guli Accept!"
 dvg_zhourao.11.d: "The Guli confederation has accepted our request to integrate them! This is a glorious day for Yaluo, as our nation stretches now across all of the Yongding!"
 dvg_zhourao.11.f: "The [concept_dod_hongshan] are an integral part of our nation."
 dvg_zhourao.11.a: "We will annex them right away"
 dvg_zhourao.12.t: "The Second [concept_dod_kongsi] War"
 dvg_zhourao.12.d: "The First [concept_dod_kongsi] war, fought between Yaluo and Mianjin, is still bitterly remembered in much of the older populace of our nation. It is now time for a second Kongsi war, this time, one that will be final."
 dvg_zhourao.12.f: "We can only end the conflict by winning."
 dvg_zhourao.12.a: "War is the only option now."
 dvg_zhourao.12.b: "No, peace is still achievable!"

 dvg_zhourao.14.t: "One [concept_dod_zhourao]"
 dvg_zhourao.14.d: "With the unification of all three [concept_dod_zhourao] polities, the nation is at last united. Centuries of invasion by the Red Sultans have been put to an end, with the final unification of [concept_dod_zhourao] under a southern, non-Islamic polity."
 dvg_zhourao.14.f: "Now is the time for stability, as hungry European powers oncemore look towards the continent, we must fend them off as one."
 dvg_zhourao.14.a: "For now, the nation can breathe a sigh of relief."

 dvg_zhourao.14.d: "In spite of the agreement between the Western powers to not encroach on [concept_dod_zhourao] , [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] finds itself directly adjacent to a signatory western power."
 dvg_zhourao.14.f: " " They're already at our doorstep! It's only a matter of time and chance before they send the troops over the border. If we don't do something, we might end up having to eat baguettes with bacon and speak French before long!"   "
 dvg_zhourao.14.a: "This is a very concerning development"
 dvg_zhourao.14.b: "Nothing wrong with that."

 dvg_zhourao.16.t: "War Against Nature?"
 dvg_zhourao.16.d: "Once again, the local fauna and flora of [concept_dod_zhourao] are a challenge to the farmers of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. With the lack of knowledge or means to protect their property, the farmers regularly face a loss of crops and livestock."
 dvg_zhourao.16.f: " "First, it was a pack of dingoes that made off with half the chicken and eggs. Attempts have been made to harvest paddies of rice, with random levels of success but a consistently sizable amount of snakes and spiders.

 dvg_zhourao.501.t: "The Kamilaluoyi Conflict"
 dvg_zhourao.501.d: "With Europeans ever encroaching towards our land, we will ensure there is plenty of desert in between us and the Europeans. We shall demand the [concept_dod_hongshan] tribes of our west bend the knee!"
 dvg_zhourao.501.f: "Hongshanman, or red barbarians from the mountains, is the name the Chinese settlers gave to the aboriginal tribes in the continent after initial contact. Over time, those friendly with the Aboriginals would drop the -man, or barbarian, and they would become just the [concept_dod_hongshan]."
 dvg_zhourao.501.a: "Onwards!"
 dvg_zhourao.502.t: "Remain Catholic?"
 dvg_zhourao.502.d: "Whilst the elite of our country are still Catholic, recent movements in the Zongting have led to our religion being called into question. Without reform, we might end up in a situation where we face a revolt from the non-catholic [concept_dod_zhourao]."
 dvg_zhourao.502.f: "God is with us, but we must honor our roots as well."

 dvg_zhourao.503.t: "Changyun in 1836"
 dvg_zhourao.503.d: "Changyun, the “island of the Long Cloud,” was discovered in the XVIIIth century by Mianjin traders on their way to Qingqiu. They managed to secure a treaty port on the North island during the Musket Wars that plagued the island after the same traders sold new weapons to the Maoli tribes. After the weakening of the tribes, the Mianjin kongsi established a permanent forum between the different iwi (confederations of tribes), so as to secure their control on the island, leading to the formation of the ‘United Tribes of Changyun’. However, this state barely exists beyond the Mianjin meeting place in Yongting. Furthemore, a popular Maoli rangatira (chief) named Tapua Te Rauangaanga is known to prefer Scandinavia to Mianjin and to be an avid military scholar. It is rumored that he entertains the idea of securing a kingdom over the whole island - and perhaps even expelling us in the process."
 dvg_zhourao.504.t: "The Middle Kongsi"
 dvg_zhourao.504.d: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Republic is the center - in all meanings of the word - of [concept_dod_zhourao]. Founded by Christian merchants from [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetName]. It developed tremendously in the XVIIIth century with the arrival of thousands of Chinese settlers who fled the endemic wars in China"
 dvg_zhourao.504.f: "The Republic has withstood assaults from the Red Sultans, established several contacts with the [GetCulture('maori').GetName] tribes, and secured the naval roads to [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetName], all the while growing more and more into a proper Little China. However, the rule of the patrician families which hold all the power in the state provoked a miner's rebellion in the South, leading to the loss of several great towns and mines to [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_YLO').GetName]. Recently, Chairman of the Assembly [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has been granted exceptional powers to stabilize the situation but many wonder if his ambitions might well change the very fabric of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] entirely."
 dvg_zhourao.504.a: "The Middle Kongsi shall unify the continent!"

 dvg_zhourao.505.t: "Tapua Te Rauangaanga Proclaimed Te Arikinu"
 dvg_zhourao.505.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] is a young and charismatic rangatira (chief) within the Hauraki iwi (confederation of tribes) who live in central Changyun."
 dvg_zhourao.505.f: "Ever since he could read, Tapua was always fascinated by Chinese folklore, especially the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. He is also a long-time trading partner of Scandinavia viewing [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MJN').GetName] with suspicion and referring to Assembly Chairman [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MJN').GetRuler.GetFullName] as “a lesser Liu Bei.” Having furnished his soldiers with European guns he first secured the loyalty of the Hauraki and then embarked on a campaign to force all other iwi to either submit to him or face destruction. As a longtime military scholar with the best troops on the island he has now exacted the support of the majority of iwi. At a ceremony in Yongting attended by scores of rangatira he proclaimed himself Te Arikinui o [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] the King of the North Island! Mianjin will be outraged by the dissolution of the Changyun council will outrage the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MJN').GetName] unless we feign loyalty and wait for the right moment...or if we ask Scandinavia to aid us."

Yet the Sultanate has flourished thanks to their position : they control the trade from Nusantara and the court in Butingshan has developed a solid system of governance that mixes Islamic thought with Confucianism.

 #Decisions
 dvg_southern_attack_again: "Attack Southwards"
 dvg_southern_attack_again_desc: "The time has come to reignite the flames of war between ourselves and the southern [concept_dod_kongsi]. They were once part of our nation, it is time they join the sultanate again."
 dvg_stay_catholic: "The Religious Debate"
 dvg_stay_catholic_desc: "With the unification of [concept_dod_zhourao], the topic of the domination of our country by Catholic Oligarchs has come into frame. The lower classes resent this, and any attempt at converting them might very well lead to another [concept_dod_kongsi] war..."
 dvg_noongar_colony: "Expand our Colony in Port-Anne"
 dvg_noongar_colony_desc: "The [concept_dod_hongshan] people of the Rivière des Cygnes, as we have taken to calling our soon to be province, are loosely organized. However, their contact with the Chinese settlers in [concept_dod_zhourao] has greatly advanced their people, and it seems that in the near future we might be looking at some form of unification of the Noongar people. We should aim to eliminate them as a threat before it can reach that level, and establish the land as a new province in our colonial empire."
 dvg_pitjantjajara_colony: "Claim the Tanami Desert"
 dvg_pitjantjajara_colony_desc: "Quite frankly, the Tanami desert is worthless. Our preliminary searches have revealed nothing but a harsh and savage people whose heathenry is unrivaled in the continent. However, the land is strategically located in the center of the continent, and the small native population cannot resist our efforts to seize it."
 dvg_yolngu_colony: "Expand our Colony in Margere"
 dvg_yolngu_colony_desc: "The Northern Region of [concept_dod_zhourao] is not the best location for a settler colony. It is a jungle where it is not a desert, and the territory suitable for settlers is limited to a band around the coast in certain areas. However, our rivals are looking to control the region, and there are many souls there we could convert. Furthermore, though the region is not the most livable, it is located strategically, through it and our islands, we can control a great deal of trade from the Chinese polities in the east, as well as look to dominate Zhusha."
 dvg_nunga_colony: "Claim Terejean"
 dvg_nunga_colony_desc: "We should expand our colony east, to border the [concept_dod_zhourao]. We have named the new land Terejean, in honor of Jean."
 dvg_yamatji_colony: "Expand our colony in Nouvelle Zélande"
 dvg_yamatji_colony_desc: "While currently used as a penal colony for our East Indies Company, the area around our holdings in western [concept_dod_zhourao] would do far better off under our control."
 dvg_kauri_colony: "Claim the Yongjia Gulf"
 dvg_kauri_colony_desc: "We should claim the valuable Yongjia gulf, without a united [concept_dod_zhourao] state, this will undoubtedly be easy. If however, the [concept_dod_zhourao] were to unite, they could seize the region themselves."
 dvg_push_southwards: "Push Southwards!"
 dvg_push_southwards_desc: "To ensure our nation's national interest, it is necessary to push the borders southwards into the [concept_dod_hongshan] tribes currently inhabiting the area"
 dvg_new_zealand: "Create the Dominion of Nouvelle Zélande"
 dvg_new_zealand_desc: "The Nouvelle-Zélande colony in Australie, with the center of its administration on the southwestern coast, is in a state of rapid development and settlement spurred by the discovery of valuable minerals in the region. The population and economic influx is such that in the future it may no longer require our direct control, and, increasingly, in recent years, colonists in Nouvelle Zélande have begun increasingly demanding home rule. It would be of interest to our country to avoid a situation akin to our former Amerigan and Arcadian colonies, and instead let them have limited self-rule, all for the purpose of serving Burgundy."
 dvg_new_zealand_integrations: "Integrate Territories into Nouvelle Zélande"
 dvg_new_zealand_integrations_desc: "We can integrate our new lands in [concept_dod_zhourao] into Nouvelle Zélande, should we choose to."
 dvg_declare_war_on_the_marra: "Declare war on the Marra"
 dvg_declare_war_on_the_marra_desc: "The Marra to our South have unified together in an attempt to resist us. This cannot be let stand. We must push southwards and conquer them, to truly unify the north."
 dvg_declare_war_on_the_wadjiginy: "Declare war on the Wadjiginy"
 dvg_declare_war_on_the_wadjiginy_desc: "The East has unified. Now, we look to the West. The Wadjiginy are a much older state than us, but to secure our hold over the north, they are a necessary step in our path to domination."
 dvg_wiradjuri_war: "Push the Border West"
 dvg_wiradjuri_war_desc: "We should aim to create a buffer zone between Mianjin and the European Colonies. We have come to a border agreement with the Europeans on a potential border, now all that is left is to seize the land from the Hongshanman who inhabit it!"
 dvg_propose_to_yaluo: "Propose increased trade with Yaluo"
 dvg_propose_to_yaluo_desc: "We should aim to further our interests in the region of [concept_dod_zhourao], and a good start would be to open Yaluo's ports to our traders"
 dvg_yaluo_ask_scandinavia_for_help: "Ask Scandinavia for aid against Mianjin"
 dvg_yaluo_ask_scandinavia_for_help_desc: "With our closer relationship to Scandinavia, we can ask for assistance in the coming war with Mianjin. This will not be free, however, and many in the Zongting worry about the concessions that Scandinavia might require of us. We can always refuse their offer, however, but it will no doubt damage our relationship with Scandinavia."
 dvg_integrate_the_guli: "Integrate the Guli Confederation"
 dvg_integrate_the_guli_desc: "If we are to unite [concept_dod_zhourao], we must first unite ourselves. Whilst relations with the [concept_dod_hongshan] have been at times strained, they have  We should petition the Guli to join our nation."

 dvg_declare_war_on_mianjin_desc: "The time has come for a Second [concept_dod_kongsi] war. We must strike first, for that will ensure our victory."
 dvg_embrace_the_koori: "Embrace the Guli"
 dvg_embrace_the_koori_desc: "The Zongting forcing the northeastern Hui to give the [concept_dod_hongshan] tribes their promised tribute has angered a conservative minority within Yaluo, but earned us the friendship and loyalty of the [concept_dod_hongshan] tribes. Relations between our peoples are better than they have ever been, and Yaluo can truly claim to be a beacon of unity and equality across [concept_dod_zhourao]. Now, a new reform will strengthen our bonds of fellowship even further. A law has been proposed by the Zongting granting each [concept_dod_hongshan] tribe full and equal membership in the League alongside the Hui, allowing each to send their own delegate. The expanded League will guarantee the rights and equality of all its people. While the tyrants in Mianjin sneer at our acceptance of the so-called "barbarians," we know that we have much to learn from the ancient culture and stewardship of the [concept_dod_hongshan]"
 dvg_songyan_society: "Sponsor the Songyan in Zhusha"
 dvg_songyan_society_desc: "Should we unify southern [concept_dod_zhourao], we can look towards taking advantage of the instability in our northern neighbor, Zhusha.

We have already been contacted by groups looking to overthrow the Sultanate and join with us, their brothers in the south."
 dvg_press_west_zhourao: "Consolidate Control  [concept_dod_zhourao]"
 dvg_press_west_zhourao_desc: "Now that [concept_dod_zhourao] proper has been unified, we should look to establish dominance over the European Colonies to our west. This will be a difficult prospect, given their large armies and navies, however, so we should look for a good opportunity to take advantage of. Additionally, should we have lost or failed to conquer any of the other [concept_dod_zhourao] states, we should look to them as well."
 dvg_darwin_seizure: "Seize Makassaran Kayu Jawa"
 dvg_darwin_seizure_desc: "Gold flows through Kayu Jawa, the port of Makassar in Northern [concept_dod_zhourao]. However, the Sultanate of Makassar has declined greatly, having at one point controlled the entirety of Celebes, now being restricted to a much smaller area around their capital. It is time for the ownership of the port to be transfered to hands more capable of protecting it."
 dvg_wadjiginy_protectorate_annex: "Annex the Wadjiginy"
 dvg_wadjiginy_protectorate_annex_desc: "With the expansion of our colony in Chougie, the time has finally come to integrate the protectorate into the colony proper. Whilst the natives might not approve of this measure, it is of little concern to us. This is simply an extension of the treaty we had previously signed with them."
 dvg_attack_northern_hongshan: "Attack the Northern [concept_dod_hongshan]"
 dvg_attack_northern_hongshan_desc: "Whilst we might have control over the port of Fort Jersey, we should look to establishing proper control over the rest of the area. There is currently a native sultan that controls the land. He will be of no issue, and will submit to our authority."
