 dvg_navarre.1.t: "Basque Independence?"
 dvg_navarre.1.d: "Navarra is at the centre of influence conflicts since the Renaissance. Forsaken by the Spanish Crown which pursued its exploration policies, Navarra was both coveted by the king of Aragon and the Anglois Dual Monarchy. Aragon attacked first and invaded Higher-Navarra in 1508. The queen from Navarra fled to her possessions in Aquitaine, Lower-Navarra. Before war erupted, a compromise was found between Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy in Perpignan: The Anglo-French would annex Lower-Navarra while the queen of Navarra would pledge fidelity to the king of Aragon."
 dvg_navarre.1.f: "Over the centuries, the political setup did not change much, with Navarra using its three neighbours against each other to preserve some independence, like with Henri III who took part in the Wars of Religion. But now, Aragon is the shadow of itself, not even considered as a Great Power by many. The king Henry IV thinks he can profit from it, by pulling his Anglo-French and Spanish allies to help him. What will possibly happen?"
 dvg_navarre.1.a: "We will contact the Anglo-French for help!"
 dvg_navarre.1.b: "We will contact the Spanish Crown for help!"
 dvg_navarre.1.c: "We are no vultures. Aragon has our loyalty!"
 dvg_navarre.2.t: "A call from Pampelune..."
 dvg_navarre.2.d: "The king of Navarra has asked us to help him in his dreams of independence. He reasoned that Aragon is decaying and through our historic and cultural ties with the Pamplonan Crown, it is our duty to intervene on his behalf. Yet, our advisors are alarmed: Aragon might be decaying but it is still not dead and might retaliate."
 dvg_navarre.2.f: "Nonetheless, Henry IV awaits an answer. Our strength might be enough to scare off Barcelona, but they nonetheless might escalate it into a war. If we don't help Henry IV, Spain might use this chance alone to finally free the Basque from the Aragonese yoke. But we could use this opportunity to gain a client state in Euskadia, although this would anger our long-time friend and ally Spain."
 dvg_navarre.2.a: "Of course, Navarra should become our puppet!"
 dvg_navarre.2.b: "He must know what his place is, and it is under the Aragonese yoke!"
 dvg_navarre.2.c: "We will support the Spanish claim without directly intervening."
 dvg_navarre.3.t: "The Dual Monarchy Threatens War"
 dvg_navarre.3.d: "The Anglois are furious at our refusal to grant them passage into Spain. Now their representative has reminded us of the old Plantagent claim to the Kingdom of Navarre...a claim they may pursue if we continue our defiance."
 dvg_navarre.3.f: "Some members of the cabinet wish to reaffirm our defiance, but others see an opportunity to use the Anglois' threats as an excuse to dissolve our ties to Aragon - even if we may only end up replacing them with the Dual Monarchy."
 dvg_navarre.3.a: "An opportunity is an opportunity."
 dvg_navarre.3.b: "We've fought the Anglois for centuries and we won't stop now!"
 dvg_navarre.4.t: "Navarre Recognizes our Claim"
 dvg_navarre.4.d: "The Navarrese have unexpectedly recognized our claim to their kingdom! They made it clear that they would not accept integration into the Plantagent realm, but they have still invited Henry IV to take up the Navarrese crown so long as we respect Navarrese autonomy."
 dvg_navarre.4.f: "It seems they recognized that their situation was hopeless, and that they prefer our protection to that of Aragon. Hopefully once this Spanish matter is solved, we can work to...revise the agreement. Needless to say, Aragon will not be pleased by all this."
 dvg_navarre.4.a: "Navarre will be free!...in a way."
 dvg_navarre.5.t: "A Chance at Freedom"
 dvg_navarre.5.d: "The Dual Monarchy is locked in conflict with Spain, but they have not sought passage through our lands. This gives us the chance to make a bid to break free of Aragonese hegemony!"
 dvg_navarre.5.f: "It may be risky, but who knows when the major powers of the Pyrenees will all be occupied with other affairs again? We must dare to be bold!"
 dvg_navarre.5.a: "Expel the Aragonese representative! Freedom awaits!"
 dvg_navarre.6.t: "Reaction from Barcelona"
 dvg_navarre.6.d: "Navarra has proclaimed its independence! They have expelled our representatives with the support of the Dual Monarchy. We could always intervene militarily and annex this kingdom we have coveted for centuries."
 dvg_navarre.6.f: "But if we do so, we will have to face the Dual Monarchy, a foe we might not be able to bring down..."
 dvg_navarre.6.a: "We will reluctantly recognize the independence of Navarra..."
 dvg_navarre.6.b: "Declare war! We will remove Navarra from the maps!"
 dvg_navarre.7.t: "A new ally?"
 dvg_navarre.7.d: "Our cowardly allies from over the Pyrenees have refused to help us! Without allies our plan is sure to fail but there is still someone who could help us."
 dvg_navarre.7.f: "The kingdom of Spain holds a dynastic claim on our little kingdom and they would be pleased to help us against Aragon, at least that is what some of our advisors and diplomats believe..."
 dvg_navarre.7.a: "Call the Spanish king!"
 dvg_navarre.7.b: "Well, it may be time to give up this folly..."
