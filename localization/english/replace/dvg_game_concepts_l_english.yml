 ##European Concepts
 concept_dvg_enlightenment: "Enlightenment"
 concept_dvg_enlightenment_desc: "The Enlightenment was a scientific, philosophical and political movement which spread across Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. Enlightenment values include rationalism, empiricism, constitutionalism, and the understanding of history as linear and progressive.\n\nWithin a context of class struggle, the Enlightenment was the result of a clash between the rising bourgeouisie, which had accumulated vast amounts of capital through colonialism and international trade, and the decadent aristocracy, which sought to hold on to its ancient privileges and monopoly on political power. After the crushing of the German Revolution, the European Enlightenment is considered to have faded, though its ideas live on in the New World through the liberal republics of Belgium and Atlantia."

 concept_dvg_inka_by_privilege: "Inka-by-Privilege"
 concept_dvg_inka_by_privilege_desc: "Though political power in the [concept_dvg_incan_empire] is normally restricted to the [concept_dvg_inka] nobility in [concept_dvg_cuzco], the [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] has the ability to grant exceptional individuals or groups the status of 'Inka-by-privilege', granting them access to restricted circles such as the [concept_dvg_qurikancha] or the [concept_dvg_yachaywasi]. The granting of this status played an important role in the empire's expansion, allowing members of conquered communities to 'lead by example' in adopting imperial customs and manners."

 #Geography (add Fusang?)
 concept_dvg_ameriga: "Ameriga"
 concept_dvg_ameriga_desc: "Discovered in the 15th century by Florentian explorer [concept_dvg_amerigo_vespucci], Ameriga is a vast and diverse continent which has seen many conflicts.\n\nWhile the east of the continent has had its demographic makeup radically altered by European settlers, who brought with them foreign diseases, established colonial states, and introduced the Atlantic slave trade, the west remains under the domain of the indigenous [concept_dvg_incan_empire]."
 concept_dvg_arcadia: "Arcadia"
 concept_dvg_arcadia_desc: "Discovered in the 15th century by Genoese explorer [concept_dvg_christopher_columbus], Arcadia is a vast and diverse continent which has seen many conflicts over the ages.\n\nThe name 'Arcadia' derives from the Romanticist concept of a utopian pastoralist society, used by the Europeans to describe the lifestyle of the indigenous groups encountered in the East Coast and the Caribbean. Following its discovery, the colonial borders of Arcadia were defined by the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_tordesilhas]. The term Arcadia is also used to refer to a union of Francophone nations in the New World, distinct from Spanish South Arcadia and the Scandinavian North, being derived from the Arcadian Empire established by Charles II Plantagenet in the early 19th century. The West Coast of the continent, settled by East Asian migrants, is known as Fusang."
 concept_dod_zhourao: "Zhourao"
 concept_dod_zhourao_desc: "The continent of Zhourao was initially discovered by [concept_dod_zheng_he] in the 15th century, but went uncolonized until much later.\n\nInitially, ownership over Zhourao was granted in its entirety to the Sultanate of Gowa by the Ming Dynasty, in exchange for a gold tax. As time went on, however, rumors of plentiful riches gave rise to a gold rush which attracted several Chinese [concept_dod_kongsi]. Combined with large immigration from Indonesia, the land gradually became islamicized. After an abortive attempt to unite the continent into a Sultanate of Zhourao, it ended up split into three Kongsi states known as Zhusha, Mianjin, and Yaluo. The word Zhourao can either mean the continent, or the Chinese who inhibit it. The name 'Zhourao' originates from the [concept_classic_of_mountains_and_rivers], in which it refers to the country of dwarves."
 concept_dod_xiangma: "Xiangma"
 concept_dod_xiangma_desc: "The Xiangma (Sound Horses) were armed bandits who rode on horseback and raided businesses and government institutions in Zhourao, making no secret of their presence with their loud instruments. Often, they would find recruits among the disenfranchised, unemployed, impoverished, or whomever felt they had better opportunities outside of the law."
 #concept_dvg_fusang: "Fusang"
 #concept_dvg_fusang_desc: ""

 #Countries (Add Zhourao, Mianjin, Yaluo?)
 concept_dvg_qingqiu: "Qingqiu"
 concept_dvg_qingqiu_desc: "The Federation of Qingqiu is a nation in Fusang organized as a union of city-states, which were colonies of the Empire of [concept_dvg_japan] until its Chinese and Korean inhabitants declared independence. Its name is Chinese for 'Green Hills', originating from the [concept_classic_of_mountains_and_rivers], where it refers to the country of the nine-tailed fox."
 concept_dvg_spanish_empire: "Spanish Empire"
 concept_dvg_spanish_empire_desc: "Formed from the union of the crowns of Portugal and Castille in the 16th century, the Spanish Empire is a globe-spanning entity known for its prestigious aristocratic culture and militant spread of Catholicism.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Reconquista, which saw the annexation of the last Muslim states in the Iberian peninsula, the Spanish Crown began to fund the expeditions of explorers and conquistadors such as [concept_dvg_christopher_columbus] and [concept_dvg_francisco_pizarro], discovering the continent of [concept_dvg_arcadia] and establishing the first European colonies in the so-called New World.\n\nDespite this, the aftermath of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution] and its associated [concept_dvg_peninsular_war] have plunged the empire into a state of decline, considered by many to have become a second-rate power at best. In addition, the rise of nationalism has carved deep divides within the kingdom itself, as Castillian and Galician groups, previously united by Catholic institutions, now agitate for their own nation-states."
 concept_dvg_dual_monarchy: "Dual Monarchy"
 concept_dvg_dual_monarchy_desc: "Officially the United Kingdom of France and England, the Dual Monarchy was formed in the 15th century after the victory of the Plantagenet dynasty in the [concept_dvg_hundred_years_war], confirmed by the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_rome].\n\nWith a Francophone elite which hosts its court in both Paris and Londres, the realm embraces the supremacy of French culture over 'medieval' Anglo-Saxon identity, though several concessions have been made to its English subjects to ensure their loyalty over the centuries. The Dual Monarchy established itself as a global power during the European Age of Sail, sponsoring the voyages of [concept_dvg_amerigo_vespucci] which led to the discovery of [concept_dvg_ameriga].\n\nYet since the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], the Dual Monarchy has grown decadent, with many of its feudal institutions being inadequate for the challenges of modernity. Amid growing nationalist agitation, a group calling themselves the [concept_dod_anglois] have risen into political prominence, hoping to transform the union of crowns into a centralized nation-state."
 concept_dvg_burgundy: "Burgundy"
 concept_dvg_burgundy_desc: "The Kingdom of Burgundy was formed in the aftermath of the [concept_dvg_hundred_years_war] and signing of the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_rome], a product of the Burgundian Dukes' ambitions for their own independent realm, uniting the most prosperous lands in Western Europe.\n\nShortly afterwards, the kingdom would establish itself as a prominent seafaring power, competing with the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire] and the [concept_dvg_dual_monarchy] for the colonization of the New World. Their embrace of Calvinist doctrine also made them a natural ally to [concept_dvg_scandinavia], establishing an alternative to the Catholic-led international order.\n\nBy the Modern Age, the Burgundians had formed their own national identity and embraced parliamentary politics, becoming one of the world's foremost nation-states. The Nederlander subjects of the Burgundian crown also integrated neatly into the political sphere, with their financial tradition fueling the Industrial Revolution and expanding the Burgundian overseas presence through the [concept_dod_voc]. Despite this, many issues in the country remain unresolved, particularly as the separation of powers between crown and state is still a mostly informal affair, with the national constitution remaining a patchwork of documents and ammendments dating back to medieval times."
 concept_dvg_scandinavia: "Scandinavia"
 concept_dvg_scandinavia_desc: "The Arch-Kingdom of Scandinavia is a centralized successor to the 16th century union of the Danish, Norwegian and Swedish crowns, or the Kalmar Union. As well as a cultural heir to the Viking conquests of old.\n\nThe Arch-Kingdom would rise as a major Euopean power in the aftermath of the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_rome] and the voyages of [concept_dvg_christopher_columbus], both considered hallmarks of Early Modernity. Its expansive fleet and naval traditions gave it an edge in the colonization of [concept_dvg_arcadia], and as a Protestant nation it was not bound by the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_tordesilhas], instead becoming partner to the Kingdom of [concept_dvg_burgundy] in establishing an alternative international order to Catholic domination.\n\nIts powerful capitalist class, comprised of Copenhagen bankers and coal barons in Scotland, would thus push for the modernization of the Scandinavian state, establishing a parliamentary system based on the Burgundian model as well as a national education program aimed at unifying the Scandinavian culture. Yet several subjects of the Norse crown remain marginalized, be they enslaved African workers in Caribbean plantations, or disenfranchised Finnish peasants subject to land enclosures and cultural assimilation."
 concept_dvg_holy_roman_empire: "Holy Roman Empire"
 concept_dvg_holy_roman_empire_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire is one of the oldest currently-existing European states, though its function and form have changed dramatically over the centuries.\n\nFormed in medieval times through the Pope's granting of the title of Roman Emperor to Europe's most powerful feudal monarchs (despite the Eastern Roman Empire living on in Constantinople), the Holy Roman Empire follows an elective system in which competing dynasties appoint candidates to assume the role of Kaiser. Out of all German noble families, the Bohemian Jagiellons emerged as the dominant power within the elective system, managing to monopolize the Kaiserreich over several centuries, especially after the defeat of their Habsburg rivals.\n\nYet it was this very sense of a 'Bohemian yoke' which turned out to be one of the leading causes of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], which broke out into two decades of war before an unsteady peace was brokered in the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris]. Though the Jagiellon remain King of the Romans, the empire is in its most fragile state in history, and seems unlikely to survive the rising tides of nationalism."
 concept_dvg_japan: "Japan"
 concept_dvg_japan_desc: "The Empire of Japan, an anciently state descended from the Yamato kingdom, assumed its modern face after the conclusion of the Sengoku period in the 16th century, which saw the conqueror Oda Nobunaga defeat his rivals and centralize the government in Kyoto. The ensuing Kōshin period saw the Oda clan assume primacy over Japan as Nobunaga's firstborn was married to the Yamato princess, merging the titles of Shogun and Emperor.\n\nThe following centuries would see Japan emerge as the dominant power over the Pacific Ocean, with the Red Seal System guaranteeing the safety and prosperity of merchants via their escort by the Imperial Japanese Navy. Despite its outward modernization, however, internal politics in Japan remained tightly controlled, with Daimyos still exerting significant control over their lands, and local economies depending entirely on the barter of rice.\n\nThe activity of fur traders in the North Pacific would eventually lead to the discovery of the continent of Fusang, where Japanese explorers would make contact with indigenous groups and colonists from the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire], who knew the area as Western [concept_dvg_arcadia]. Although the Emperor sought to claim and settle the gold-rich area, restrictions on migration placed by the Daimyos forced the state to instead sponsor Chinese and Korean colonists. This colonial project would lead Japan to fight two wars against the Spanish, resulting in the empire annexing former Spanish California, and stabilizing its presence in the region now known as [concept_dvg_qingqiu], until its independence in 1818."
 concept_dvg_rum: "Ottomans"
 concept_dvg_rum_desc: "The Ottoman Empire (also referred to as the Empire of Rum or the Turkish Empire) is the name given to a Turkish Muslim state formed after the Ottoman Conquest of Constantinople by Sultan Mehmet II in 1453. Though initially governed by the tolerant and bureaucratic Ottoman dynasty, a succession crisis in the the 17th century saw the rise of the Iskenderid sultans, who delegated more power to local nobility and began aggressive campaigns of conversion in the Balkans."
 concept_dvg_incan_empire: "Incan Empire"
 concept_dvg_incan_empire_desc: "Founded in 1438 by [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] [concept_dvg_pachacuti], the Incan Empire is one of the oldest still-extant civilizations in [concept_dvg_ameriga].\n\nUpon the arrival of the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire], troops led by conquistador [concept_dvg_francisco_pizarro] attempted to conquer the sacred city of [concept_dvg_cuzco] and bring the Andes under the domain of the Spanish crown, though they were repelled by forces led by [concept_dvg_ninan_cuyochi]. Since then, the empire has been engaged in perpetual conflict with those it deems the 'European barbarians'. After the [concept_dvg_first_andine_war], the [concept_dvg_chimu] population of the [concept_dvg_chinchaysuyu] became subject to Catholic conversion by the [concept_dvg_jesuit], with the region eventually breaking loose and joining the Spanish Empire under the leadership of pretender [concept_dvg_paullu_tupac_cuzi].\n\nDespite this loss, the Incan Empire endured, holding onto its traditional worship of [concept_dvg_inti] and the rule of the [concept_dvg_inka] while also adopting several elements of modernity, such as the firearms and cavalry tactics introduced by the expedition of [concept_dvg_francois_bart]. Its vast silver reserves made it a valuable ally to the mercantilist kingdoms of [concept_dvg_burgundy] and [concept_dvg_scandinavia], and the 'modernizer emperor' [concept_dvg_poma_waman_amaru] of the 17th century would invest heavily into diplomacy and technological advancement, leasing two treaty ports to the Europeans while also signing the [concept_dvg_incan_japanese_treaty] with the Empire of [concept_dvg_japan]."

 #Important Locations
 concept_dvg_cuzco: "Qusqu"
 concept_dvg_cuzco_desc: "The capital of the [concept_dvg_incan_empire], Qusqu is the center of power from which all four [concept_dvg_suyu] are governed, as well as the site of the [concept_dvg_qurikancha] and the most prestigious of the [concept_dvg_yachaywasi].\n\nGathered in the city are the noble [concept_dvg_inka] clans, including the Hurin Qusqu dynasty from which the [concept_dvg_sapa_inka] descends. Due to its central position and political significance, Qusqu serves as the lynchpin which connects the extensive road systems of the [concept_dvg_qhapaq_nan] and the [concept_dvg_siq'i]."

 concept_dvg_chinchaysuyu_desc: "The northern [concept_dvg_suyu] of the [concept_dvg_incan_empire], as well as its most populous, Chinchaysuyu was established in the 15th Century after the annexation of the moon-worshipping [concept_dvg_chimu] Kingdom.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Spanish invasion, the Chinchaysuyu became the primary conflict zone between the Incans and the Spaniards, being host to the initial invasion by conquistador [concept_dvg_francisco_pizarro], the 16th Century [concept_dvg_battle_of_quito] and [concept_dvg_first_andine_war], the War of Succession between [concept_dvg_paullu_tupac_cuzi] and [concept_dvg_poma_waman_amaru] in the 17th Century, as well as the [concept_dvg_fifth_andine_war] in the early 19th Century."
 concept_dvg_kuntisuyu: "Kuntisuyu"
 concept_dvg_kuntisuyu_desc: "The central [concept_dvg_suyu] of the [concept_dvg_incan_empire], Kuntisuyu is the smallest yet most important of all districts, containing the capital city of [concept_dvg_cuzco], as well as its surrounding highlands and the nearby coasts."

Though broadly successful, Amaru's policies resulted in the region being host to what some call a 'perpetual war' with the southern [concept_dvg_mapuche]."

 #Buildings and Infrastructure
 ##Incan

 #Cultures
 ##Europe
 concept_dod_anglois: "Anglois"
 concept_dod_anglois_desc: "Anglois is a Catholic, Parisian Cosmopolitan, Francophone culture which is defined by its allegiance to the Union of England and France.\n\nBeing quite similar to continental French in terms of customs and mannerisms, referring to onself as French or Anglois is primarily a matter of political leaning. In England, however, the difference is larger, as most Anglois-in-England are pressured to learn French as a second language out of various economic or socio-political motivations, subject to a cultural assimilation project which drives many to revolt."
 ##Zhourao
 concept_dod_hongshan: "Hongshan"
 concept_dod_hongshan_desc: "Hongshanman, or red barbarians from the mountains, is the name the Chinese settlers gave to the aboriginal tribes in [concept_dod_zhourao] after initial contact.\n\nOver time, those friendly with the Aboriginals would drop the suffix -man, or 'barbarian', and they would become known simply as 'Hongshan'. Many have been heavily influenced by the contact with the Chinese settlers, seen as part of a broader Sinosphere. However, in the northern reaches of the continent, the Hongshan are more influenced by Islam and the Sultanate of Gowa, or Makassar."
 concept_dvg_maoli: "Máolì"
 concept_dvg_maoli_desc: "Máolì is the Chinese transliteration of Maori, it is used due to first contact with the Maori being tied to the discovery of [concept_dod_zhourao]."
 ##Ameriga

Some native groups are even reported to have adopted the term as a self-descriptor, considering it as a mark of pride against colonialism, cultural assimilation, and the disruption of traditional ecosystems."
 concept_dvg_anglo_lotharian: "Anglo-Lotharian"
 concept_dvg_anglo_lotharian_desc: "When Burgundian colonists first arrived on the River Plate basin, their dreams were of establishing a prosperous colony enriched by the silver trade flowing from the [concept_dvg_incan_empire] to the west. Yet the harsh environment of the Pampas and harrassment by [concept_dod_anglois] corsairs quickly put an end to this illusion.\n\nIn the end, rather than leasing their platine land to a company charter, the Burgundian Crown sought to kill two birds with one stone by encouraging the Anglican refugee population of the Netherlands, who frequently caused tensions with the locals and the neighboring [concept_dvg_dual_monarchy], to settle the 'vast and fertile lands' of Southern Ameriga. After the Lotharian War of Independence, those of Anglo descent who remained in the new Francophone republic became known as the Anglo-Lotharians, while those of radical sects and cultural purists travelled further south, founding the Kingdom of Beornia."
 concept_dvg_andino: "Andino"
 concept_dvg_andino_desc: "A catch-all term for those descended of mixed-race marriages between Europeans and Native Andean peoples, Andinos are most prevalent in the northern Andes, known to the Spanish as New Toledo and to the Incans as [concept_dvg_chinchaysuyu].\n\nIntermarriage played a crucial role in facilitating Spanish colonization, allowing conquistadors to build ties to prominent families and gain access to the language. Although they are excluded from metropolitan politics due to the casta system, many academics in Quito see the Andino as a 'cosmic race', mixing the perceived best qualities of Europeans and Andeans."
 concept_dvg_quechua: "Quechua"
 concept_dvg_quechua_desc: "The primary ethnic group of the [concept_dvg_incan_empire], the Quechua are a native people of the central Andes, or the [concept_dvg_kuntisuyu].

Aimara families are organized into clans known as [concept_dvg_ayllu].\n\nPrior to the Incan conquest, the Aimara lived in lordships scattered across the Qullaw highlands. Though these lordships have in the past formed pan-regional states such as the Tiwanaku Empire, knowledge of these pre-Incan states is deliberately suppressed by the [concept_dvg_amauta] as part of imperial assimilation policies."
 concept_dvg_chimu: "Chimu"
 concept_dvg_chimu_desc: "Descended from the ancient Moche culture, the Chimu are a native people of the northern Andes, or the [concept_dvg_chinchaysuyu]. Distinct from the rest of the Andes, the former Kingdom of Chimor had a flourishing market economy, as well as a significant metalworking tradition.\n\nThough the Chimu once worshipped Quillapa Huillac, deity of the moon, the influence of Spanish missionaries has resulted in a majority of the population being converted to Catholicism.

 concept_dvg_hundred_years_war_desc: "The Hundred Years' War was a series of conflicts lasting from 1337 to 1498 between ruling dynasties of England and France. The Plantagenet dynasty, ruling over England, inherited a claim to the French throne dating back to the medieval conquest of Guillame le Conqueiránt, and held several territories in continental France as a result of this.\n\nThe war, which despite its name actually lasted 150 years, experienced periods of intense clashes and relative peace, though it would turn decisively in the Plantagenets' favor after the defeat of Valois heroine Joan of Arc, derided as Joan the Mad by [concept_dod_anglois] historians. Though the conflict had reached its informal end by the 1450s, with stable zones of control being formed by the Plantagenets, the Valois, and the secessionist Burgundian Dukes, official peace was only signed via the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_rome] in 1498."

With the country on the brink of civil war, the liberal King José II seized the throne and began to implement reforms to move the country towards a constitutional monarchy. The Dual Monarchy, however, fearful of a revolutionary state forming on its border, could not accept this and intervened, invading through the Kingdom of Navarre to place the reactionary pretender Pedro III on the Spanish throne.\n\nAfter seven years of brutal conflict, the conservative forces won, though Spain was devastated and had much of its infrastructure destroyed. King Pedro proceeded to issue the 'Petrine Reforms', which levied heavy taxes upon the colonies in order to fund the Spanish reconstruction, though this had the catastrophic side-effect of instigating widespread revolt in the colonies, many of which played host to exiled liberal factions, culminating in the expulsion of colonial garrisons from New Spain by the revolutionary Colombian Alliance."

Battles ensued across the forests and farmlands of Pskov and Novgorod whilst small mobilised Karelian forces harrassed the roads near Onega. As the Scandinavians prepared for an assault of Novgorod, the Posadnik was overthrown and a collection of petty nobles and princes signed a collective peace at Sordavala. \n\nThe Treaty of Sordavala would see [concept_dvg_scandinavia] take control of several small islands in Lake Lagoda and total control over fishing rights in the lake, along with re-establishing Scandinavian merchants' rights in Novgorod, with the promise that they would continue to trade with the Novgorodians, as to not harm existing businesses too greatly.

Believing himself to be in India, he referred to the native populations as 'Indians', an exonym which remains in use to this day. Though celebrated as a pioneer and a hero of the Age of Sail, with his name becoming synonymous with discovery and the European civilizing mission, Columbus' relationship with the Spanish Crown eventually grew strained, as his brutal behavior as a colonial governor and his attempts to establish dynastic privileges over the New World for himself resulted in lengthy legal disputes which eventually led to his arrest and removal from power."

Starting from 1497, Vespucci would participate in several expeditions which charted the eastern shores of Ameriga, so far thought to be little more than a southern extension of the Arcadian continent. Unlike his Genoese counterpart, Vespucci never sought ownership over the lands he discovered, though the prosperity brought to the Plantagenets through his claim of highly-fertile lands confirmed him as the namesake for the southern continent."
