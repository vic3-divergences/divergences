 dvg_illyria.1.t:0 "The Flight of Bosniak Beys"
 dvg_illyria.1.d:0 "The Beys of Banat have long held power in the region due to the importance of the region as a military frontier. In recent years, they have started a revolt against the Hungarians, inspired by the Hungarian mistreatment of islam, and all minorities in their empire. They have, however, been defeated. Now, we face a huge refugee crisis, as the 'Bosniaks' as the turkicized slavs are being called, have fled south into Bosnia. Already our government is struggling to meet their needs, and we risk a bosniak revolution should we provoke them by demanding they assimilate."
 dvg_illyria.1.f:0 "A trouble begins, but how we treat this will decide the fate of our nation."
 dvg_illyria.1.a:0 "We greet our Slavic brothers with open arms."
 dvg_illyria.1.b:0 "They can come, but they must know that they will have to assimilate."
