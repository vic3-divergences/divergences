 dvg_salvador.1.t: "The De Marquez State"
 dvg_salvador.1.d: "General Puente de Marquez is a man with a checkered past. Once a staunch monarchist and Spanish loyalist, his defection to the Colombian Alliance was critical in securing control of southern Arcadia during the first period of the independence war. His actions may have been celebrated, but his former identity as an enemy of both Colombia and of republicanism continues to haunt him."
 dvg_salvador.1.f: "Nevertheless, he has taken control of the land of his birth and proclaimed the United Provinces of South Arcadia, also known colloquially as “Greater Salvador” given that the province of San Salvador is the region’s political heart. While many people have called for a democratic republic, de Marquez has insisted that dictatorial rule is a sad necessity “until the period of crisis has passed” and the nation is stabilized. This news has not been received well - particularly in the northern lands of the Maya…"
 dvg_salvador.1.a: "What does the future hold for our new nation?"
 dvg_salvador.2.t: "The Breakup of South Arcadia"
 dvg_salvador.2.d: "Presidente Puente de Marquez, our long-suffering leader, passed away last night, after complaining of severe headaches shortly before retiring to bed. His death has marked the sundering of the nation, as local elites repudiate the central government whom they only obeyed due to the personal charisma of de Marquez and his clique of confidants."
 dvg_salvador.2.f: "The remaining Federalistas have gathered in San Salvador to declare an independent republic, yet have refused to recognize the current state of calamity as anything but temporary. Yet few can imagine how South Arcadia could be reunited after this tumult…"
 dvg_salvador.2.a: "We must press on, with or without the rest of South Arcadia!"
 dvg_salvador.3.t: "A Cotillón of Caudillos"
 dvg_salvador.3.d: "President de Marquez is faced with a formidable task in keeping South Arcadia in line. The region was always the least developed part of the Spanish Empire and independence has only worsened this situation. Our country can be envisioned as a constellation of urban centers surrounded by rough rural regions.Thus we must rely upon local elites to support our government until we can create the necessary infrastructure to project power from the capital."
 dvg_salvador.3.f: "Said elites are often more interested in protecting their status than in holding our nation together. Nowhere is this more true than in the north, where brutal treatment of the Maya natives by landowners has seen the emergence of an armed insurgency aimed at creating a Maya republic, based on romantic nationalist interpretations of the precolonial League of Mayapan. Worst of all, our people lack a nationalist ideal to rally around, despite shared religious and linguistic ties. Therefore there are few options for de Marquez other than continued reliance upon “Church and county”."
 dvg_salvador.3.a: "...at least for now."
 dvg_salvador.4.t: "The Mayan Insurrection"
 dvg_salvador.4.d: "For weeks, the northern provinces have resisted attempts by the central government in [SCOPE.sState('capital_state').GetName] to investigate the Mayan insurgency or the social circumstances which led to it. Now the price of their hubris has come due, as open warfare has broken out in the north between armed bands of Maya and local criollo militias."
 dvg_salvador.4.f: "We have since learned that the chief grievances of the Maya are encroachments onto their traditional lands by Hispanic settlers, and an increasing attempt by provincial officials to pressure them to adopt Hispanic language and culture. Given old Spanish customs of segregating native and settler communities, this is seen as a great affront by the Maya, who have taken up arms to oppose further internal colonization. So far the Mayan tribes have yet to rally around a single leader, but while most rebel groups might be satisfied with internal autonomy within the federal government, a notion of pan-Mayan nationalism is drawing more and more Mayan tribes together into a single, angry collective."
 dvg_salvador.4.a: "We cannot tolerate Mayan secessionism!"
 dvg_salvador.5.t: "The Great Gambit of De Marquez"
 dvg_salvador.5.d: "President de Marquez can no longer tolerate resistance by the church, the caudillos, and the natives to his agenda. While he has no desire to repeat the past mistakes of previous Colombian politicians, the geographical realities of South Arcadia make it extremely difficult for a federal state to function at the moment. Therefore, after a secretive meeting with his most trusted officials, he has announced the suspension of the federal articles and the creation of the unitary Republic of Salvador!"
 dvg_salvador.5.f: "De Marquez has explained his actions as being “motivated by utter necessity” in order to address both the ongoing Mayan insurrections and a general “inadequacy of the bureaucracy, of local institutions and of their administrative structures.” He closed this shocking address by assuring the public that a new federal constitution will be adopted as soon as possible. #red We must build a national identity and achieve sufficient international prominence to rally our people beneath the Salvadoran dream, or else we will surely perish.#"
 dvg_salvador.5.a: "Long live the republic! Long live President de Marquez!"
 dvg_salvador.6.t: "The Death of President Puente de Marquez"
 dvg_salvador.6.d: "President Puente de Marquez recently returned from a vacation to Italy with his wife Ismelda, and was thought to be in unusually good health for a man of his age. This morning, however, his wife awoke to find her husband had passed away in his sleep. All of South Arcadia is now in mourning for de Marquez, the man who truly earned the sobriquet “the Savior of Salvador.”"
 dvg_salvador.6.f: "While even contemporary critics have called de Marquez a dictator who steered the South Arcadian ship of state into a virtual monarchy, none can deny that President de Marquez built not only the Salvadoran nation but the Salvadoran national identity. Even now, the once-monolithic Partido Federalista, hailed as the only party in Hispanic Arcadia to transcend the liberal-conservative divide, is schisming between those who see de Marquez as a monarchist who vindicated his beliefs and those who see him as a radical who valued national progress over the whims of petty caudillos. For now, let us give thanks for the endurance of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] through his leadership."
 dvg_salvador.6.a: "Rest in peace, savior of the nation."
 dvg_salvador.7.t: "The Battle of San Salvador"
 dvg_salvador.7.d: "Chaos has erupted in [SCOPE.sState('capital_state').GetName]! What was supposed to be the solemn opening of the first sitting of the National Cortes since President de Marquez’s death has instead devolved into a vicious struggle between the two wings of the Partido Federalista, due to the unexpected disappearance of de Marquez’s draft for the new constitution."
 dvg_salvador.7.f: "On one side are the liberals, who declare that de Marquez, in the vein of Marinus Dahlke and his Imperial Republic of Germany, intended to use his accumulated power to establish true democracy and bring vast political freedoms to the people. On the other side are the conservatives, who claim that de Marquez, like King Jean VI of Burgundy, desired a modernized monarchy to lay a strong foundation for Salvadoran institutions. Given the power of the Partido Federalista on a national level, whichever side prevails in this confrontation will likely be able to impose its will across the country…"
 dvg_salvador.7.a: "The liberals prevail and bring forth democracy!"
 dvg_salvador.7.b: "The conservatives prevail and crown Puente’s son as King Sergio I!"
 dvg_salvador.8.t: "United No Longer"
 dvg_salvador.8.d: "Federal authority in South Arcadia has been dealt an irreparable blow, as one of the provinces has declared outright independence. This shocking demonstration of the weakness of the central government has led to a domino effect, with province after province deserting [SCOPE.sState('capital_state').GetName] and falling into the hands of local elites."
 dvg_salvador.8.f: "It is rumored that Andagoya might even request Spanish protection, an act which would surely outrage the rest of southern Arcadia. The central government has refused to recognize any of these declarations of independence, but it is doubtful that San Salvador can restore authority by force of arms. The United Provinces of South Arcadia are united no longer."
 dvg_salvador.8.a: "Perhaps this was our destiny…"
 dvg_salvador.9.t: "The Salvadoran Revolution"
 dvg_salvador.9.d: "President Puente de Marquez and the one-party rule of the Partido Federalista have been ousted from power, his dictatorship now a thing of the past. Whether it was by peaceful pressure or violent struggle is by now irrelevant. Province after province has refused to recognize the authority of [SCOPE.sState('capital_state').GetName] any longer, instead declaring independence with the backing of local elites."
 dvg_salvador.9.f: "It is rumored that Andagoya might even request Spanish protection, an act which would surely outrage the rest of southern Arcadia. The central government has refused to recognize any of these declarations of independence, but it is doubtful that San Salvador can restore authority by force of arms. South Arcadia has become a constellation of new nations, each facing an uncertain future."
 dvg_salvador.9.a: "Freedom, for better or for worse."
 dvg_salvador.10.t: "The End of the Salvadoran State"
 dvg_salvador.10.d: "Last night President Puente de Marquez, our long-suffering leader, was found dead in his study from what doctors believe was a brain aneurysm brought on by extreme stress. His death, rather than rally national sympathy, has thrown our nation into chaos. De Marquez’s compromises and deals with provincial officials have evaporated in the wake of his demise and many haciendados have already thrown their support behind local strongmen to declare independence."
 dvg_salvador.10.f: "It is rumored that Andagoya might even request Spanish protection, an act which would surely outrage the rest of southern Arcadia. De Marquez’s loyalists, the “Federalistas,” have gathered in San Salvador and the central government has refused to recognize the independence of the provinces, complicating matters even further. Whatever the fate of South Arcadia, it shall be anything but peaceful."
 dvg_salvador.10.a: "We cannot escape darkness…"
 dvg_salvador.11.t: "The Recovery of Andagoya"
 dvg_salvador.11.d: "A ray of hope has shone through the gloom of our loss of New Spain. The collapse of government authority in southern Arcadia has left the province of Andagoya adrift. This small territory commands one of the most strategic locations on Earth, the main transit point of goods between the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans by means of the Caribbean Sea."
 dvg_salvador.11.f: "We have now received an urgent letter from the governor of New Granada, in which he explains that several rich and powerful Andagoyans have reached out to him in secret. They propose to return Andagoya to Spanish control! It seems that these men belong to a small secret society of monarchists which has endured since the end of the Colombian War of Independence. Now they have offered to use their military contacts and resources to execute a coup d’etat which would deliver Andagoya back into our control…assuming that all of them are assured high-ranking posts in the restored colonial government."
 dvg_salvador.11.a: "Of course! Anything to regain the isthmus."
 dvg_salvador.11.b: "We have other plans in mind for Andagoya."
