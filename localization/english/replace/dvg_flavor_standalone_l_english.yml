 dvg_standalone_flavour.1.f: ""I was standing on the bank of a river some hours from Stung Treng, far north of Phnom Penh. There I saw the stag, he stood and stared at me, his antler's the shape of a lyre and brown fur shimmering, far whiter than any stag I had seen on my many adventures to the Highlands. I began to sketch him immediately, however he turned away only a moment later, I named it after my father who I loved dearly; Walter Barclays.""

 dvg_standalone_flavour.3.t: "Mulberry Trees & Mountains beyond the Valley"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.3.d: "Sericulture amongst Qingqiuans has persisteded for centuries on the small-scale, but now with the growth of the industry, the White Mulberry Trees used for it have spread far and wide, beyond the limits of the orchard fences"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.3.f: "With the continued expansion of the silk inudstry in the Valley, the presence of Mulberry trees have only become greater, spreading far and wide across the valley, many elderly valley-dwellers remember a time where they weren't as widespread and different plants grew in greater numbers, only to be choked out by the hardy trees. Now there have been sightings of Mulberry trees growing beyond the Xueshan, hugging the few permanent rivers of Dayan and now spreading as far east as Menzhou. Many people say that someday the trees will cross the Mingxing Shan, yearning for the rivers of the Great Plains, perhaps becoming a common sight across all of [concept_dvg_arcadia]..."

 #Qingqiun Kanhu
 dvg_standalone_flavour.4.t: "Singing in the Kanhu Room"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.4.d: "Kanhu is a widely popular game amongst all Qingqiuans, now the first Kanhu Palace has been constructed in [SCOPE.sState('scope_qingqiuan_kanhu_state').GetName], serving as a hub for not only Kanhu players, but many different performers, gamblers and public speakers!"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.4.f: "Qingqiuan Kanhu is an adaptation of Kanhu, having evolved gradually, instead of using coins and string, mock-coins were used in the early 1500s before being banned by Japanese bureaucrats. This forced Kanhu players to use depections of natural scenery on slips of paper, with streams, mountains and dwellings instead, with some regional variation. Now most households have a Kanhu set, with wealthier people having sets printed on wood rather than paper, in 1829 a particularly famous set was made out of worked gold, which was eventually sold to a wealthy gold-mining family. The new Kanhu Palace has quickly become a bustling cultural hub, in particular singers have began to perform on the lower levels of the building, with one of the most famous songs being "Kanhu Room", telling the story of a nervous child intimidated by their mother as they play Kanhu together, having forgotten how to play, the child instead daydreams of singing and playing with his friends in the room."
 dvg_standalone_flavour.4.a: "'Come sing it again my friend!'"
 
 #Scandinavian National Animal
 dvg_scandinavian_national_animal: "A National Animal for Scandinavia?"

 dvg_standalone_flavour.5.d: "Initially beginning as an idea in cosmopolitan circles of Scandinavia, the idea of a national animal has made its way to our government. A novel idea, surely to please most, we will select one to represent all Scandinavians!"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.5.f: "After a lengthy process and several, overly-heated dinner debates, we have been presented with a list of animals and reasoning behind each one as to why it should be a candidate for the national animal of Scandinavia. Perhaps there is a little pressure on us to make something that will please all, however in due time surely all will come to see whichever animal we select as a unifying figure of all of Scandinavia and all Scandinavians!"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.5.a: "The Mute Swan; its elegance and beauty represents our people and country. It's quiet yet poised nature represents Scandinavians' attitudes to be thoughtful yet fierce when need be, a true representation of the Scandinavian people."
 dvg_standalone_flavour.5.b: "The Scandinavian Lynx; quiet, enduring and skilled, it represents the Scandinavian work ethic and the hardiness of our people, it is favoured by some nobles due to it being present on heraldry, additionally, some sketches show that its kittens are quite adorable!"
 dvg_standalone_flavour.5.c: "The Brown Bear; intelligent, powerful and protective, a perfect representation of Scandinavia on the world stage, these honourable creatures are widespread across almost all Scandinavian-speaking lands and represent not just Scandinavian citizens, but all Scandinavians."
 dvg_standalone_flavour.5.e: "The Eurasian Perch; plentiful and ever-persistent, an odd choice, being the only fish on the list given to us, yet a representation of the Scandinavian middle class and peasants, the Perch is a true representation of all Scandinavians, not just the wealthy."
 dvg_standalone_flavour.5.h: "A novel concept indeed, yet too novel, we have no need for this."
