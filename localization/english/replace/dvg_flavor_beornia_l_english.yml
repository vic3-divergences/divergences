  conquest_new_cornwall.1.t: "Settling New Cornwall"
  conquest_new_cornwall.1.d: "We have completed our long campaign to conquer the lands christened New Cornwall. Settlers are beginning to seek out promising sites from which to establish new towns and exploit the region's natural resources."
  conquest_new_cornwall.1.f: "The Mapuche fought long and hard for centuries to protect their lands from us. Now at last they are defeated, and the lands of New Cornwall are indisputable ours. Now we must set ourselves to the task of populating and governing what we have won."

  dvg_beornia.1.t: "The English Monarchy in Exile"
  dvg_beornia.1.d: "Far away from its ancestral homeland, sits the only independent English-speaking country in the world."
  dvg_beornia.1.f: "Beornia is by all metrics the youngest nation in Ameriga as it was only claimed by English settlers in the 17th century crossing the Odon river, living in small towns often unknown by the Burgundian colonial administration. Over time, they developed a peculiar mindset of exiles distrustful of foreigners and keen to protect their language and culture with the wealthier among them being known as [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName]. \n\n One of these [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName], Harold Cavendish, claimed descent from the House Cavendish that once held the title of 'Duke of Newcastle'. His house was recognized to rule over these English-settled areas by the Burgundian authorities in 1709 for his efforts in destroying the Anglois settlement of Nouveau Havre that once inhabited the area. Now, with the Burgundians gone thanks to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] seeing the opportunity in helping Lotharingia's ruling class in their civil war and fight for independence, there are some in the government who seek to use this as a foundation to expand [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s influence further; whether it be annexing new lands or reclaiming old ones." 
  dvg_beornia.1.a: "Maybe one day more people will speak English."
  dvg_beornia.2.t: "Border Raids"
  dvg_beornia.2.d: "As Beornians expand the nation's frontiers, they often engage with conflict with indigenous people already living in the area."
  dvg_beornia.2.f: "A firebrand on Beornian expansionism, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s uncle, Prince [SCOPE.sCharacter('landowners_leader').GetFirstName] is known to be leading raids on indigenous villages at the outer reaches of our country.\n \nSome in the capital question if allowing armed farmers and herdsmen armed with antiquated weapons to go on assaults along the Incan border is a wise idea, but these raiders are beloved as crusading heroes by the local populace."
  dvg_beornia.2.a: "These raids need to stop immediately. Anyone raiding the border will be treated as if they raided Camelot."
  dvg_beornia.2.b: "Beornians should not be ashamed of fighting for their country! Let our heroes do as they please!"

  dvg_beornia.3.t: "Beornian Raiders"
  dvg_beornia.3.d: "In recent years, bands of armed men from [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BEO').GetName] have led frequent raids along our southeastern border, pillaging and razing peaceful villages while infringing on our sovereignty and displacing our civilians."
  dvg_beornia.3.f: "Rumor has it that the one leading these raids is a Beornian prince, raising the question on whether these raids are spontaneous or state-sponsored. With the rise of our new [concept_dvg_sapa_inka], many in the empire are hoping that a decisive solution to the 'Beornian Question' can be achieved at last."
  dvg_beornia.3.a: "For our safety, the border must be pushed away from the mountains."
  dvg_beornia.3.b: "We can't stand idly by as these savages brutalize our people. To arms! Destroy their pathetic excuse of a kingdom!"
  dvg_beornia.3.c: "Arrange a meeting with King [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_king_edward').GetFirstName] — we will seek a diplomatic solution."

  dvg_beornia.4.t: "Beornia's Immigration Policy"
  dvg_beornia.4.d: "Given the country's cultural heritage and future ambitions, the issue of immigration policy has become a heated debate among the country's populace."
  dvg_beornia.4.f: "Unsurprisingly, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] want a stricter immigration policy to preserve power, while members of our clergy believe we are stronger with more of our culture within our country, but anyone else would ruin our character. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('industrialists_ig').GetName] by contrast, think having an ample amount of labor regardless of their background would greatly improve our situation, though this would radicalize the other Beornians who will see this as unecessary increased competition for land and employment."
  dvg_beornia.4.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] for Beornians only! Close the border!"
  dvg_beornia.4.b: "We can use more people, but preferably those of our kind."
  dvg_beornia.4.c: "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses..."

  dvg_beornia.5.t: "A Union of the Crosses"
  dvg_beornia.5.d: "Due to our two countries' shared history, government, family ties, and culture, we have taken a step towards uniting under a shared crown."

  dvg_beornia.7.d: "Being close to our South Atlantic Islands, [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BEO').GetName] would like to take the opportunity to take them off our hands."
  dvg_beornia.7.f: "Initially, we used these islands as a refueling stop, but given our modern-day technology and economic situation, these might not be so necessary to keep."
  dvg_beornia.7.a: "Sure, they can have a few rocks in the middle of nowhere."
  dvg_beornia.7.b: "Scandinavian territory is NOT to be purchased by a bunch of cattle peasants!"

  dvg_beornia.8.t: "The Lotharian Question"
  dvg_beornia.8.d: "Since [SCOPE.sCountry('aigle_country').GetName] has collapsed, we have our options of how to deal with our weakened neighbor."
  dvg_beornia.8.f: "Some might say the fact we are considering this in the first place might be a backstab to Denis de Aigle, but to be fair he still owes us for helping him secure power to begin with."
  dvg_beornia.8.b: "We will help our old ally. as long as they accept our protection."
  dvg_beornia.8.a: "We can unite Lotharingia ourselves."
  dvg_beornia.8.c: "[SCOPE.sCountry('aigle_country').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_de_aigle').GetFullName] will receive our help as our client state."

  dvg_beornia.9.t: "Cattle Barons' Coup"
  dvg_beornia.9.d: "Despite his desire to bring [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] into the modern age, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has failed to reconcile his own interests with that of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName]."
  dvg_beornia.9.f: "Discontent with the King, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] marched on the capital with guns and loyal soldiers to coup the government and have appointed the King's uncle [SCOPE.sCharacter('landowners_leader').GetLastName] as the new leader while the rest of Edward's family is believed to have fled to Lotharingia. King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] accepted and signed his renouncement to the throne. Now Prince [SCOPE.sCharacter('landowners_leader').GetFirstName] has embarked on a policy of restoring [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to a place of order and integrity."
  dvg_beornia.9.a: "...and so begins the start of the Carolean Era!"

  dvg_beornia.10.t: "Cattle Barons Thwarted"
  dvg_beornia.10.d1: "King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has successfully managed to curtail the influence of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] on the country and uncovered a plot to overthrow him."
  dvg_beornia.10.d2: "Thanks to the abolition of the monarchy, Prince [SCOPE.sCharacter('landowners_leader').GetFirstName] and the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] have lost the political power to carry out their plans on the country, including a plot to forcibly reverse the recent changes." 
  dvg_beornia.10.f: "Prince [SCOPE.sCharacter('landowners_leader').GetFirstName] has subsequently been arrested alongside the other [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] who were seeking to stage a coup. Now, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can choose any destiny that its true King has set for it without worrying about the wrath of the old elite."
  dvg_beornia.10.a: "God Save Our Gracious King! Long may he reign!"

  dvg_beornia.11.t: "Powers of Parliament"
  dvg_beornia.11.d: "With King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] and the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] being influential, the distribution of political power in the country has come into question."
  dvg_beornia.11.f: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName]are demanding that they have get some special voting privileges, being part of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s nobility. The harder reactionaries meanwhile demand the King not compromise with anyone else, while the reformers and radicals insist we give every Beornians a voice if the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] can too. However, allowing all Beornians a chance to have an equal vote in parliament would dillute the power of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName]' political clout, which they are well aware of."
  dvg_beornia.11.a: "King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] and any successors will maintain absolute authority. Parliament has no real power."
  dvg_beornia.11.b: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] and other aristocrats can share power within parliament."

  dvg_beornia.12.d: "For the tenure of his rule, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] managed to stay in charge of his country, not angering any interest group too much. "
  dvg_beornia.12.f: "In the end, he wasn't able to curtail the influence of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName], who still have a powerful hold on the nations' politics. Still, as nobody has managed to abolish the monarchy either it is safe to say [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can just simply continue existing as it always has." 
  dvg_beornia.12.a: "Long Live Beornia?"

  dvg_beornia.13.t: "A Scandinavian Intervention?"
  dvg_beornia.13.d: "A man by the name of Lars Hayardal who immigrated here from [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetName] is asking to join our government as an advisor, despite having no records of his past whatsoever. He says he is merchant who wants to protect the international fur trade and bolster our economy."
  dvg_beornia.13.f: "Upon, hearing this request, many in our government laughed him off, as if we would let a random foreigner into an official government experience. However, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] believes this can also be an opportunity to help the country modernize. Welcoming him as an advisor might help increase investment in our country and boost international relations, but would displease the already-established interest groups."
  dvg_beornia.13.a: "Let this guy do what he wants here. The more company the merrier!"
  dvg_beornia.13.b: "This guy is clearly a conman. Throw him out."

  dvg_beornia.14.t: "A Scandinavian Adventurer"
  dvg_beornia.14.d: "A man by the name of Lars Hayardal from [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetName] has come to claim he can protect us from the Beornians and Inca."
  dvg_beornia.14.f: "The Mapudungun people have always fiercely resisted centralization only coming together in timesof war to protect themselves from the invaders. As years go by we have seen times changing. When we could resist the ・Inka・ be they Quechua or Beornian seems like a long time ago. The tribes accepted peace even if it meant to see our enemies grow stronger. But now has come a formidable man Lars Heyerdhal a great explorer and commander who has heard of our plights and propose to wage war to recover our lost lands. A council of the main tribes of our country has declared him ・toqi・, our leader."
  dvg_beornia.14.a: "Long Hail Our Savior!"

  dvg_beornia.15.t: "The Conman Returns!"
  dvg_beornia.15.d: "Seemingly disillusioned by not being able to join our government advisory, Lars Hayardal has gone south and managed to rally the Mapuche to resist our rule."
  dvg_beornia.15.f: "Strange news come from Southern Ameriga. In two days we have received a demand from clarification from our representative in the Incan Empire and a letter of friendship from the so-called ・King of Araucania and Patagonia・ Karl-Lars von Heyerdhal. Reports seem to indicate that Lars Heyerdhal was months ago just a worthless subject of the Crown but he has apparently taken over the Mapuche tribes as their king and want to expel the Incas from their lands. While he seems like a madman he could serve our interests. Numerous tribes inhabit the Southern Cone : let them unite under a King of our obedience while we settle the Magellan strait."
  dvg_beornia.15.a: "Any obstacle to our expansion must be crushed."
  dvg_beornia.15.b: "All hail King Lars of Patagonia!"

  dvg_beornia.16.t: "A Curious Family Reunion"
  dvg_beornia.16.d: "A rather bizarre story happened in Camelot as an Anglois explorer named Jean de Courtenay has been spreading some troubling rumors regarding our country's nobility."
  dvg_beornia.16.f: "He himself claims to be a lost relative of the Carter household and was here to visi this cousins. However, upon suggesting to Cattle Baron John Carter that his family are really the Courtenay who had survived the burning of Le Nouveau Havre in 1650, he was immediately thrown out of their house. This came as a surprise to most because the Carters were regarded as true Englishmen. \n\n However, this Courtenay fellow has seemingly legitimate-looking records that indicate he is in fact a relative of the Carters. Not only that, the records he brought with him seem to also be suggesting that the monarchs of our country were not originally from the noble House Cavendish of England, but instead just from some commoner farming family. This has questioned the legitimacy of the government in our country."
  dvg_beornia.16.a: "Let's hear more of what this man has to say."
  dvg_beornia.16.b: "There is no basis to these claims."

  dvg_beornia.17.t: "Odonia Secedes!"
  dvg_beornia.17.d: "Although we have already ousted Denis de Aigle from power, it seems one of his relatives, [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ODO').GetRuler.GetFullName], has established a his own fiefdom in the southwestern states as "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ODO').GetName]" to stage some kind of family comeback and restore the "good ol days"."
  dvg_beornia.17.f: "However, this new wannabe prince could not have pulled this off on his own. Shortly after his declaration, the Beornians have openly declared their support and recognition of this secessionary state. We can try to take our sovereign territory back, but doing so would mean a war with [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BEO').GetName] and give them a justification to try and annex us too."
  dvg_beornia.17.a: "Tyrants are not welcome here, new or old! No more Aigles!"
  dvg_beornia.17.b: "We are better off just not engaging these kinds of people."
  dvg_beornia.17.c: "The Beornians are right! [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has become too liberal and republican!"

  dvg_beornia.18.t: " Britannia vs. Ameriga "
  dvg_beornia.18.d: "Following the claims made on the rest of the continent, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has decided to take action."
  dvg_beornia.18.f: "  As for the justification for such a war, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has unveiled a rather colorful vision - 'I have a dream. A dream where Ameriga is spelled correctly with the letter 'c', where it is possessed by one country - that speaks English and is united with several states living under its unquetionsable hegemony as now just a great power- but as a superpower - with its influence and prestige known far and wide.'  " 
  dvg_beornia.18.a: "The rest of Ameriga will be kneel before us immediately! (Warning: This option will result in becoming a near-pariah and create annex diplomatic plays against the rest of the continent)"
  dvg_beornia.18.b: "Let's be patient."

  dvg_beornia.19.t: "The Rise of the Holy Britannian Empire"
  dvg_beornia.19.d: "A new threat has emerged in the south of the Amerigan continent, in the form of a belligerent empire under a delusional ruler."
  dvg_beornia.19.f: "The newly self-proclaimed emperor of the 'Holy Britannian Empire' has announced his plans to conquer as much of the world as he possibly can. He has demanded that we relinquish our sovereignty and submit to his rule or face the wrath of an army with capabilities that mankind has never seen before." 
  dvg_beornia.19.a: "What could he possibly be talking about? We can stop them!"
  dvg_beornia.19.b: "This threat sounds very real, we surrender!"

  dvg_beornia.20.t: "The Cattle Barons' Revolt"
  dvg_beornia.20.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s current direction under King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] have alienated the Cattle Barons enough to the point that a plot was uncovered to oust him using collaborators in the military. Due to the limited support of this coup, the King was able to still stay as head of state and arrest these conspirators."
  dvg_beornia.20.f: "Thanks to their lingering influence however, many were able to escape incarceration and have fled the capital and gather their own militants to overthrow the government. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] now finds itself in a state of civil war to determine the ruling interest group. Given that the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] have become insurrectionary however, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('industrialists_ig').GetName] has been able to consolidate more influence in the part of parliament still loyal to the King.

However, the Cattle Barons claim that they have owned these lands for generations, and are solely qualified to own all of it. Even better, they say, would be to reinforce medieval policies of serfdom as was done in old England, so that they can more efficiently run the country's farms.

  dvg_hbe.9.f: " To many [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective], the country has become a land of many new faces - seeing diversity architectually, demographically, and spiritually. King Edward's pivot towards industralization naturally increased labour demand - and consequently more immigrants of a wide array of flavours. Meanwhile, the new half-Lotharian [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has already gained a reputation of being too embracing of Beornia's new developments during his time as Crown Prince - regularly consuming and introducing foreign imports from his palace, going on worldwide tours for several months at a time on the taxpayer's expense, and being an open philanderer with rumors of him hoping to legalize polygamy - something monarchs in the East apparently do."

Meanwhile, the influx of migrants from Lotharingia and Scotland in particular have brought new life to [concept_dod_beo_presbyterian] institutions in the country.

Although they are still known as 'Presbyterians' in official government records, some of these dissenters are calling themselves 'The Woke' as being part of a supposed 'Great Awakening' that academics have labeled the current demographic and political shift.

If [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] wanted to avoid being torn apart and stay united, it was time for a new form of Christianity together. Of course, it is still unedeniable Beornians were all men of God who believed in the preachings of the Bible. However, there would need to be a new bible. A unifying code for the new [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] - that now was a different place from whence it was founded.

  dvg_hbe.18.f: " The heads of the various churches were allotted land to continue that practices, with the integration of the new state ideology. Alongside the parliament have gathered in Camelot to commemorate the appointment of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] as Emperor. His cousin was given the title King and [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_john_faith').GetFullName] given a high ranking within the church, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_robin_hood').GetFullName] was put in charge of tax collection. Parishers and Presbyterians respectively were given permission to set up colonies and missions anywhere they pleased. Talks of integrating the other Protestants and Christians have been made as well.

Thou shalt not commit murder, thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not cheat, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife. All of these are lies! Mere illusion, nothing more! They don't want to be killed, they don't want to be robbed. Using the twin lies of justice and morality, the weak endeavor to protect themselves.

Inequality is not wrong, equality is. Imagine if our enemies had won. What of the Presbyterians which wanted equality as a right? Rabble politics by a popularity contest. The Parishers who wanted an equal distribution of wealth? A nation of lazy dullards. But not our beloved Britannia, we fight, we compete, evolution is continuous. Britannia alone moves forward, advancing steadily into the future. Even the death of my cousin, Henry, demonstrates Britannia's unswerving commitment to progress.

  dvg_england.1.b: "We don't want to face the ire of the Dual Monarchy."

  dvg_england.2.t: "Beornia Requests Yorkshire Estate"
  dvg_england.2.d: "Beornia requests that their royal family be given ownership of the area around Newcastle, claiming they are descendants of the very same House Cavendish that ruled over the area. "
  dvg_england.2.f: "" 
  dvg_england.2.a: "Sure, they can have a few acres of land."
  dvg_england.2.b: "We don't owe them anything!"


  dvg_england.8.t: "Beornians Request a Summit"
  dvg_england.8.d: "Following our recent independence, our distant relatives in Ameriga, the Beornians, have proposed for a summit for future cooperation."
  dvg_england.8.f: "The ruling Cavendish family of Beornia claims descent from the very same Cavendish family that once ruled as dukes of Newcastle in Yorkshire. Although this claim is disputed by some scholars, perhaps we can leave an open mind for a fellow Anglophone sovereign state?" 
  dvg_england.8.a: "Let's see what the Beornians want!"
  dvg_england.8.b: "We do not have time to deal with this."

  dvg_england.9.t: "England Accepts Summit!"
  dvg_england.9.d: "As we had hoped for, the newly independent England is open for dialogue to discuss our future cooperation."
  dvg_england.9.f: "It has been centuries since Beornians have become a seperate identity from the English, but surely we can still understand one another." 
  dvg_england.9.a: "Hopefully we can keep calm and carry on."

  dvg_england.10.t: "Failure of the Pan-Anglo Summit"
  dvg_england.10.d: "Despite having a shared language and heritage, the cultural differences and conflicting political interests of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and England proved too great for unity."
  dvg_england.10.f: "The English people in England were deemed 'too French' for the Beornian politicians who now have become more nationalist than before the summit. Meanwhile, those in England saw no reason to share governing power with or incorporate a far-removed distant land on another continent, preferring to limit the scope of their realm."

  dvg_england.11.t: "The Question of Sovereignty"
  dvg_england.11.d: "As we grow closer to cooperation, the question has arisen on how customs and sovereignty should be handled. "
  dvg_england.11.f: "There are those in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] who believe that King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] should be the rightful ruler of all Anglophone people. Of course, this would be a very difficult sell to England, as most people there may not even be aware of our king's existence. We could also ask to be under their sovereignty instead, though this might upset some within our own country." 
  dvg_england.11.a: "The people of England must accept the rule of a true English King, and that king just happens to be Beornian!"
  dvg_england.11.b: "We are clearly in a lesser position. Let's accept being under England's rule."

  dvg_england.12.t: "A Beornian King Of England?"
  dvg_england.12.d: "The Beornians have asked us to submit to the rule of their king."
  dvg_england.12.f: "There are those in Beornia who believe that their King should be the rightful ruler of all English people. Obviously, this is a preposterous idea to even consider since many in England don't know of him or would even dispute the legitimacy of his noble lineage. Even if their ruling king really is the legitimate descendant of House Cavendish, that's only the claim to a duchy and not an entire kingdom. Still, there are a few reactionaries in Yorkshire who would might be pleased by this, though the rest of the country would feel differently." 
  dvg_england.12.a: "Well, at least we would have a King that isn't French!"
  dvg_england.12.b: "And replace one foreign monarch for another? No thanks."

  dvg_england.13.t: "England Refuses Our King!"
  dvg_england.13.d: "It seems for whatever reason the government in England decided against submitting to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] rule, even though the family lineage can be traced back there! "
  dvg_england.13.f: "The delegates of England have called our proposal to be 'preposterous' and said they will not become the colony of an 'inbred backwater'. Obviously, this has gravely insulted the people of our nation."

  dvg_england.15.d: "The Beornians have asked to be put under our sovereignty as we are owners of their 'promised land'. "
  dvg_england.15.f: "While we might not have much to lose by accepting their offer, what the relationship should be is still up for debate. Annexing them would give us more resources, but any potential problems there could spill over to the rest of our country." 
  dvg_england.15.a: "We should be safe if we just keep them in our market, only as a protectorate."
  dvg_england.15.b: "Maybe [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] really could rule the waves..."
  dvg_england.15.c: "A dominion of Beornia sounds nice..."

  dvg_england.16.t: "A Pan-Anglo Customs Union?"
  dvg_england.16.d: "It seems neither the English nor the Beornians can agree on which country's leader should be the main sovereign. Therefore, a customs union was suggested as a compromise."
  dvg_england.16.f: "This way, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can take advantage of Beornia's vast agricultural land and Beornia can gain all the perks of England's industrialization. Perhaps this sounds fair?" 
  dvg_england.16.a: "We should not have to share a market with stupid 'Cattle Barons' and their ilk."
  dvg_england.16.b: "God Save the Invisible Hand!"

  dvg_england.17.t: "The Issue of Language and Citizenship"
  dvg_england.17.d: "With our shared cultural heritage, the debate on how to handle our language and culture has come up."
  dvg_england.17.f: "Beornia insists that we remove the 'French elements' from our culture and have English literacy be a requirement for citizenship. However, given our long rule under the Dual Monarchy, many within our borders speak French as a primary or secondary language and are even practicing Catholics as well. As such, while acquiescing with the Beornian demands may please them, it would disenfranchise a different part of our population." 
  dvg_england.17.a: "We agree, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] must stay true to being English!"
  dvg_england.17.b: "This is clearly impractical. We are all Britons!"

  dvg_england.18.t: "England Refuses to Compromise on the French Question"
  dvg_england.18.d: "Delegates from England have told us they refuse to disenfranchise a significant portion of their populace to appease us."
  dvg_england.18.f: "Despite our own delegates' insistence they remove the 'French elements' from their culture and have English literacy be a requirement for citizenship, it seems they want to take a more liberal approach? Given their long rule under the Dual Monarchy, many within their borders speak French as a primary language and are follow Catholicism as the preferred faith. Some in our government wonder whether it is still worthwhile to cooperate with an England that is willing to compromise on its culture." 
  dvg_england.18.a: "To be fair, we are foreigners in our own land too..."
  dvg_england.18.b: "What even is the point if England isn't gonna be English?"

  dvg_england.19.t: "England for the English"
  dvg_england.19.d: "England has agreed to help purge French influence from their territory. "
  dvg_england.19.f: "If there is anything we can bond our, it is that this world has too much Francophone already." 
  dvg_england.19.a: "We are ever close to restoring England to its authentic self."

  dvg_england.20.t: "England's Religion"
  dvg_england.20.d: "Thanks to Plantegenet rule, the Catholic Church has a much more prevalent presence in England than any Protestant branch."
  dvg_england.20.f: "Upon being independent however, there are nationalists within England and from Beornia to change the official state religion to be that of the Anglican Church, which preaches of England being a 'promised land' and to build a new 'Jerusalem' within its borders. However, changing faiths like this would alienate many Britons who are already Catholic." 
  dvg_england.20.a: "We shall follow the prayers of London and Avalon, not Rome!"
  dvg_england.20.b: "The Catholics have been, and always will be the true Christians!"
  dvg_england.20.c: "Why choose between a state church when we can just be a secular country?"

  dvg_england.21.t: "England Embraces the Anglican Church!"
  dvg_england.21.d: "In order to appease more nationalist sentiments, England has opted to change their state religion away from Catholicism."
  dvg_england.21.f: "Already, the heads of the Anglican Churches in Beornia and in England are calling for a meeting to discuss the further integration of their institutions. Already, the French and Latin names found in churches, on hospitals, schools, are being renamed into more English-sounding ones with 'Jerusalem' being considered for an English national anthem." 
  dvg_england.21.a: "The language of prayer is the language of belief!"

  dvg_england.22.t: "England Rejects the Anglican Church!"
  dvg_england.22.d: "Rather than embracing the Anglican faith as their state religion, England has stuck to the same Catholic Church as its former overlord."
  dvg_england.22.f: "Citing concerns about their relations with the rest of Europe and how much younger our church is, the government England says they fail to see our church's doctrine is legitimate enough for them to adopt. They say they will stick to the one true form of Christianity." 
  dvg_england.22.a: "Clearly they're the heretics, not us!"

  dvg_england.23.t: "England Decides to be Secular!"
  dvg_england.23.d: "Unable to choose their state religion, England's government has announced they will be moving towards secularism instead and try to not favor any religion over the other."
  dvg_england.23.f: "According to the Beornian delegates partaking in the summit, it was unclear if they were doing this as a way to distance themselves from us or their neighbors across the channel, or if they were going down a godless route. Instead, all they got were conflicting 'wishy-washy' answers that made it more unclear." 
  dvg_england.23.a: "What is going on here?"


  dvg_patagonia.1.t: "The Conquest of the Desert"
  dvg_patagonia.1.d: "We have completed our long campaign to conquer the Patagonian south. Settlers are beginning to seek out promising sites from which to establish new towns and exploit the region's natural resources."
  dvg_patagonia.1.f: ""The Mapuche fought long and hard for centuries to protect their country. Now at last they are defeated, and that land belongs to us. To the victor, the spoils. Now we must set ourselves to the task of populating and governing what we have won.""
  dvg_patagonia.1.a: "At last, the south belongs to us."
  dvg_patagonian_settlement: "Patagonian Settlement"
  dvg_patagonia.2.t: "Arming the Natives"
  dvg_patagonia.2.d: "We have discovered that our rivals in [SCOPE.sCountry('rival_country').GetName] have been arming the [SCOPE.sCountry('patagonia_country').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] natives in [SCOPE.sState('patagonia_state').GetName]. This is likely to impede our efforts to conquer the region."
  dvg_patagonia.2.f: ""The [SCOPE.sCountry('patagonia_country').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] natives have never welcomed our presence, but without the means to mount a truly effective resistance we have paid little heed to their objections. The addition of [SCOPE.sCountry('rival_country').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] munitions into the equation comes with the frightening possibility that we must face them on equal terms.""
  dvg_patagonia.2.a: "We should de-escalate the situation."
  dvg_patagonia.2.b: "If they want a fight, they'll get one."

  dvg_beo_lot_union_desc: "King Edward is already married to Denis de Aigle's daughter establishing a shared bloodline between the ruling Aigle and Cavendish families.

  dvg_cavendish_yorkshire: "Restore the Cavendish Estate"
  dvg_cavendish_yorkshire_desc: "Although the Cavendish family that once rule Newcastle is long gone and our claim to be descended from them is controversial, England still owes us an obligation. Surely they won't mind giving us a few acres of land for the help we've given them."

 concept_dod_beo_parisher: "Parisher"
 concept_dod_beo_parisher_desc: "The 'Parishers' are a broad group of people who inhabit the vast plains of Beornia - developing in isolation of the mainstream church of the country. Throughout much of their existence, their settlements have often brought them into conflict with indigenous populations and missionaries of other faiths, leading to a distrust of non-Beornians and pagans."
 
 concept_dod_beo_presbyterian: "Presbyterian"
 concept_dod_beo_presbyterian_desc: "Though originally tracing its origins to Scottish Churches resistant to Roman rule, the Presbyterian movement in Beornia and Lotharingia has come to encompass Republican ideals, emphasizing that 'there is no King but Christ' and that the Christian faith is meant to be worldly and egalitarian nature - as opposed to something that can be embraced by a certain counrty's elites."
