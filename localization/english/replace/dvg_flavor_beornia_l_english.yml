je_conquest_new_cornwall_reason: "The Kingdom of Beornia's southern border was marked by the river Graham after a treaty with the Mapuche tribes who have resisted our earlier attempts at settling these lands.

conquest_new_cornwall.1.t: "Settling New Cornwall"
conquest_new_cornwall.1.d: "We have completed our long campaign to conquer the lands christened New Cornwall. Settlers are beginning to seek out promising sites from which to establish new towns and exploit the region's natural resources."
conquest_new_cornwall.1.f: "The Mapuche fought long and hard for centuries to protect their lands from us. Now at last they are defeated, and the lands of New Cornwall are indisputable ours. Now we must set ourselves to the task of populating and governing what we have won."
conquest_new_cornwall.1.a: "Today New Cornwall, tomorrow the Cone!"

dvg_beornia.1.t: "The English Monarchy in Exile"
dvg_beornia.1.d: "Far away from its ancestral homeland, sits the only independent English-speaking country in the world."
dvg_beornia.1.f: "Beornia is by all metrics the youngest nation in Ameriga as it was only claimed by English settlers in the 17th century crossing the Odon river, living in small towns often unknown by the Burgundian colonial administration. Over time, they developed a peculiar mindset of exiles distrustful of foreigners and keen to protect their language and culture with the wealthier among them being known as [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName]. \n\n One of these [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName], Harold Cavendish, claimed descent from the House Cavendish that once held the title of 'Duke of Newcastle'. His house was recognized to rule over these English-settled areas by the Burgundian authorities in 1709 for his efforts in destroying the Anglois settlement of Nouveau Havre that once inhabited the area. Now, with the Burgundians gone thanks to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] seeing the opportunity in helping Lotharingia's ruling class in their civil war and fight for independence, there are some in the government who seek to use this as a foundation to expand [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s influence further; whether it be annexing new lands or reclaiming old ones." 
dvg_beornia.1.a: "Maybe one day more people will speak English."

dvg_beornia.2.t: "Border Raids"
dvg_beornia.2.d: "As Beornians expand the nation's frontiers, they often engage with conflict with indigenous people already living in the area."
dvg_beornia.2.f: "A firebrand on Beornian expansionism, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s uncle, Prince [SCOPE.sCharacter('landowners_leader').GetFirstName] is known to be leading raids on indigenous villages at the outer reaches of our country.\n \nSome in the capital question if allowing armed farmers and herdsmen armed with antiquated weapons to go on assaults along the Incan border is a wise idea, but these raiders are beloved as crusading heroes by the local populace."
dvg_beornia.2.a: "These raids need to stop immediately. Anyone raiding the border will be treated as if they raided Camelot."
dvg_beornia.2.b: "Beornians should not be ashamed of fighting for their country! Let our heroes do as they please!"

dvg_beornia.3.t: "Beornian Raiders"
dvg_beornia.3.d: "In recent years, bands of armed men from [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BEO').GetName] have led frequent raids along our southeastern border, pillaging and razing peaceful villages while infringing on our sovereignty and displacing our civilians."
dvg_beornia.3.f: "Rumor has it that the one leading these raids is a Beornian prince, raising the question on whether these raids are spontaneous or state-sponsored. With the rise of our new [concept_dvg_sapa_inka], many in the empire are hoping that a decisive solution to the 'Beornian Question' can be achieved at last."
dvg_beornia.3.a: "For our safety, the border must be pushed away from the mountains."
dvg_beornia.3.b: "We can't stand idly by as these savages brutalize our people. To arms! Destroy their pathetic excuse of a kingdom!"
dvg_beornia.3.c: "Arrange a meeting with King [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_king_edward').GetFirstName] — we will seek a diplomatic solution."

dvg_beornia.4.t: "Beornia's Immigration Policy"
dvg_beornia.4.d: "Given the country's cultural heritage and future ambitions, the issue of immigration policy has become a heated debate among the country's populace."
dvg_beornia.4.f: "Unsurprisingly, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] want a stricter immigration policy to preserve power, while members of our clergy believe we are stronger with more of our culture within our country, but anyone else would ruin our character. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('industrialists_ig').GetName] by contrast, think having an ample amount of labor regardless of their background would greatly improve our situation, though this would radicalize the other Beornians who will see this as unecessary increased competition for land and employment."
dvg_beornia.4.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] for Beornians only! Close the border!"
dvg_beornia.4.b: "We can use more people, but preferably those of our kind."
dvg_beornia.4.c: "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses..."

dvg_beornia.5.t: "A Union of the Crosses"
dvg_beornia.5.d: "Due to our two countries' shared history, government, family ties, and culture, we have taken a step towards uniting under a shared crown."
dvg_beornia.5.f: "This might anger some of the more nationalist elements within our country, but they might come to accept this over time."

dvg_beornia.6.t: "A Union of the Crosses"
dvg_beornia.6.d: "Due to our two countries' shared history, government, family ties, and culture, we have taken a step towards uniting under a shared crown."
dvg_beornia.6.f: "This might anger some of the more nationalist elements within our country, but they might come to accept this over time."
dvg_beornia.6.a: "Long live House [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName]-[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BEO').GetRuler.GetLastName]!"

dvg_beornia.7.t: "Beornia wants to purchase the Falklands"
dvg_beornia.7.d: "Being close to our South Atlantic Islands, [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BEO').GetName] would like to take the opportunity to take them off our hands."
dvg_beornia.7.f: "Initially, we used these islands as a refueling stop, but given our modern-day technology and economic situation, these might not be so necessary to keep."
dvg_beornia.7.a: "Sure, they can have a few rocks in the middle of nowhere."
dvg_beornia.7.b: "Scandinavian territory is NOT to be purchased by a bunch of cattle peasants!"

dvg_beornia.8.t: "The Lotharian Question"
dvg_beornia.8.d: "Since [SCOPE.sCountry('aigle_country').GetName] has collapsed, we have our options of how to deal with our weakened neighbor."
dvg_beornia.8.f: "Some might say the fact we are considering this in the first place might be a backstab to Denis de Aigle, but to be fair he still owes us for helping him secure power to begin with."
dvg_beornia.8.b: "We will help our old ally. as long as they accept our protection."
dvg_beornia.8.a: "We can unite Lotharingia ourselves."
dvg_beornia.8.c: "[SCOPE.sCountry('aigle_country').GetName] will receive our help, but not as our client state."

dvg_beornia.9.t: "Cattle Barons' Coup"
dvg_beornia.9.d: "Despite his desire to bring [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] into the modern age, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has failed to reconcile his own interests with that of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName]."
dvg_beornia.9.f: "Discontent with the King, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] marched on the capital with guns and loyal soldiers to coup the government and have appointed the King's uncle [SCOPE.sCharacter('landowners_leader').GetLastName] as the new leader. King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] accepted and signed his renouncement to the throne. Now Prince [SCOPE.sCharacter('landowners_leader').GetFirstName] has embarked on a policy of restoring [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to a place of order and integrity."
dvg_beornia.9.a: "...and so begins the start of the Carolean Era!"

dvg_beornia.10.t: "Cattle Barons Thwarted"
dvg_beornia.10.d1: "King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has successfully managed to curtail the influence of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] on the country and uncovered a plot to overthrow him."
dvg_beornia.10.d2: "Thanks to the abolition of the monarchy, Prince [SCOPE.sCharacter('landowners_leader').GetFirstName] and the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] have lost the political power to carry out their plans on the country, including a plot to forcibly reverse the recent changes." 
dvg_beornia.10.f: "Prince [SCOPE.sCharacter('landowners_leader').GetFirstName] has subsequently been arrested alongside the other [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] who were seeking to stage a coup. Now, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can choose any destiny that its true King has set for it without worrying about the wrath of the old elite."
dvg_beornia.10.a: "God Save Our Gracious King! Long may he reign!"

dvg_beornia.11.t: "Powers of Parliament"
dvg_beornia.11.d: "With King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] and the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] being influential, the distribution of political power in the country has come into question."
dvg_beornia.11.f: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName]are demanding that they have get some special voting privileges, being part of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s nobility. The harder reactionaries meanwhile demand the King not compromise with anyone else, while the reformers and radicals insist we give every Beornians a voice if the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] can too. However, allowing all Beornians a chance to have an equal vote in parliament would dillute the power of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName]' political clout, which they are well aware of."
dvg_beornia.11.a: "King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] and any successors will maintain absolute authority. Parliament has no real power."
dvg_beornia.11.b: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] and other aristocrats can share power within parliament."
dvg_beornia.11.c: "All Beornians can share power within parliament."

dvg_beornia.12.t: "The Forseeable Future of Beornia"
dvg_beornia.12.d: "For the tenure of his rule, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] managed to stay in charge of his country, not angering any interest group too much. "
dvg_beornia.12.f: "In the end, he wasn't able to curtail the influence of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName], who still have a powerful hold on the nations' politics. Still, as nobody has managed to abolish the monarchy either it is safe to say [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can just simply continue existing as it always has." 
dvg_beornia.12.a: "Long Live Beornia?"

dvg_beornia.13.t: "A Scandinavian Intervention?"
dvg_beornia.13.d: "A man by the name of Lars Hayardal who immigrated here from [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetName] is asking to join our government as an advisor, despite having no records of his past whatsoever. He says he is merchant who wants to protect the international fur trade and bolster our economy."
dvg_beornia.13.f: "Upon, hearing this request, many in our government laughed him off, as if we would let a random foreigner into an official government experience. However, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] believes this can also be an opportunity to help the country modernize. Welcoming him as an advisor might help increase investment in our country and boost international relations, but would displease the already-established interest groups."
dvg_beornia.13.a: "Let this guy do what he wants here. The more company the merrier!"
dvg_beornia.13.b: "This guy is clearly a conman. Throw him out."

dvg_beornia.14.t: "A Scandinavian Adventurer"
dvg_beornia.14.d: "A man by the name of Lars Hayardal from [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetName] has come to claim he can protect us from the Beornians and Inca."
dvg_beornia.14.f: "He might be crazy, but many of our people are coming to like him. Maybe if [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetName] can protect us, we can still preserve our independence to some degree."
dvg_beornia.14.a: "All hail King Lars of Patagonia!"

dvg_beornia.15.t: "The Conman Returns!"
dvg_beornia.15.d: "Seemingly disillusioned by not being able to join our government advisory, Lars Hayardal has gone south and managed to rally the Mapuche to resist our rule."
dvg_beornia.15.f: "Many in our government are also shocked by the news of a delusional man of Scandinavian descent claiming to be the King of Mapuche. Contacts in our European embassies seem to know nothing of this man, while the official Scandinavian envoy to our nation says they are still in contact with the government in [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetName] on how to deal with this situation."
dvg_beornia.15.a: "Any obstacle to our expansion must be crushed."
dvg_beornia.15.b: "All hail King Lars of Patagonia!"

dvg_beornia.16.t: "A Curious Family Reunion"
dvg_beornia.16.d: "A rather bizarre story happened in Camelot as an Anglois explorer named Jean de Courtenay has been spreading some troubling rumors regarding our country's nobility."
dvg_beornia.16.f: "He himself claims to be a lost relative of the Carter household and was here to visi this cousins. However, upon suggesting to Cattle Baron John Carter that his family are really the Courtenay who had survived the burning of Le Nouveau Havre in 1650, he was immediately thrown out of their house. This came as a surprise to most because the Carters were regarded as true Englishmen. \n\n However, this Courtenay fellow has seemingly legitimate-looking records that indicate he is in fact a relative of the Carters. Not only that, the records he brought with him seem to also be suggesting that the monarchs of our country were not originally from the noble House Cavendish of England, but instead just from some commoner farming family. This has questioned the legitimacy of the government in our country."
dvg_beornia.16.a: "Let's hear more of what this man has to say."
dvg_beornia.16.b: "There is no basis to these claims."

dvg_beornia.17.t: "Odonia Secedes!"
dvg_beornia.17.d: "Although we have already ousted Denis de Aigle from power, it seems one of his relatives, [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ODO').GetRuler.GetFullName], has established a his own fiefdom in the southwestern states as "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ODO').GetName]" to stage some kind of family comeback and restore the "good ol days"."
dvg_beornia.17.f: "However, this new wannabe prince could not have pulled this off on his own. Shortly after his declaration, the Beornians have openly declared their support and recognition of this secessionary state. We can try to take our sovereign territory back, but doing so would mean a war with [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BEO').GetName] and give them a justification to try and annex us too."
dvg_beornia.17.a: "Tyrants are not welcome here, new or old! No more Aigles!"
dvg_beornia.17.b: "We are better off just not engaging these kinds of people."
dvg_beornia.17.c: "The Beornians are right! [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has become too liberal and republican!"

dvg_beornia.18.t: "The Declaration of the Holy Britannian Empire"
dvg_beornia.18.d: "With [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] becoming a prominent power on the world stage, but still having been unable to retake England, its ruler has decided to take the country into a different direction, as King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] claims he was given a divine revelation."
dvg_beornia.18.f: " In his newly published 'Book Britannia', he tells the nation: 'I was surveying our land in the Andes, where upon the ground collapsed beneath me and I fell into a cavern. There, I met a green-haired angel in a futuristic-looking capsule. She revealed to me a most vivid prophecy, where Britons win conflict after conflict with weapons and abilities I have never seen before; where English becomes THE international language and the sun never sets on our Empire!' \n\n Some scholars speculate that this might be our king hallucinating from consuming psychedelic mushrooms on his trip, but nonetheless he has absolute authority and his ambitions cannot be abated. He is now dead-set on world domination." 
dvg_beornia.18.a: "The rest of Ameriga will be kneel before us immediately! (Warning: This option will result in becoming a pariah and create annex diplomatic plays against the rest of the continent)"
dvg_beornia.18.b: "Let's be patient."

dvg_beornia.19.t: "The Rise of the Holy Britannian Empire"
dvg_beornia.19.d: "A new threat has emerged in the south of the Amerigan continent, in the form of a belligerent empire under a delusional ruler."
dvg_beornia.19.f: "The newly self-proclaimed emperor of the 'Holy Britannian Empire' has announced his plans to conquer as much of the world as he possibly can. He has demanded that we relinquish our sovereignty and submit to his rule or face the wrath of an army with capabilities that mankind has never seen before." 
dvg_beornia.19.a: "What could he possibly be talking about? We can stop them!"
dvg_beornia.19.b: "This threat sounds very real, we surrender!"

dvg_beornia.20.t: "The Cattle Barons' Revolt"
dvg_beornia.20.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s current direction under King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] have alienated the Cattle Barons enough to the point that a plot was uncovered to oust him using collaborators in the military. Due to the limited support of this coup, the King was able to still stay as head of state and arrest these conspirators."
dvg_beornia.20.f: "Thanks to their lingering influence however, many were able to escape incarceration and have fled the capital and gather their own militants to overthrow the government. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] now finds itself in a state of civil war to determine the ruling interest group. Given that the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] have become insurrectionary however, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('industrialists_ig').GetName] has been able to consolidate more influence in the part of parliament still loyal to the King. " 
dvg_beornia.20.a: "Long Live [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]!"

dvg_beornia.21.t: "Reviewing Agricultural Policy"
dvg_beornia.21.d: "Given the agrarian economy of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], the distribution of land has become a central issue."
dvg_beornia.21.f: "As [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has ample unused arable land, many lower-class Beornians are hoping that they can have their own farm and build their own wealth one day. However, the Cattle Barons claim that they have owned these lands for generations, and are solely qualified to own all of it. Even better, they say, would be to reinforce medieval policies of serfdom as was done in old England, so that they can more efficiently run the country's farms. The yields will trickle down to the peasants they say." 
dvg_beornia.21.a: "Let the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('cattle_barons_ig').GetName] continue owning most of the land as they always have."
dvg_beornia.21.b: "If we truly want to be like our ancestors, we should enforce serfdom."
dvg_beornia.21.c: "If any Beornian can find any unclaimed land, it's theirs!"

dvg_beornia.22.t: "Western Territories Demand Autonomy!"
dvg_beornia.22.d: "Feeling alienated by our government, the Beornian [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('rural_folk_ig').GetName] living west of the Andes are demanding-rule."
dvg_beornia.22.f: " "Follow me lead, countrymen! Shall we heed to our god given destiny, we can make throw off the yoke of the east coast elitists, and we can make every man a King!" - [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_NME').GetRuler.GetFullName] " 
dvg_beornia.22.a: "They will get nothing."
dvg_beornia.22.b: "They can get autonomy, but they still must answer to the Beornian government."
dvg_beornia.22.c: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_NME').GetName] will become the beacon of Freedom!"

dvg_beornia.23.t: "Beornia Demands Tranfleuve!"
dvg_beornia.23.d: "As we are now at peace, [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_LOT').GetRuler.GetLastName] is calling the obligation we owe them, saying we must give them Transfleuve. "
dvg_beornia.23.f: " “Must” - is that not a strong word to use? Who says that de Aigle “must” do anything? By what right do they seek to compel le Chef to submit to them? Perhaps we could refuse. Perhaps we could fight them..." 
dvg_beornia.23.a: "There has been enough bloodshed, cede it."
dvg_beornia.23.b: "No obligation is worth ceding a square inch of our territory."

dvg_beornia.24.t: "Lotharingia Refuses to Cede Transfleuve!"
dvg_beornia.24.d: "Despite the obligation owed, [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_LOT').GetRuler.GetLastName] believes that nothing is worth ceding any bit of their territory."
dvg_beornia.24.f: " "Obligations? What obligations? Those cattle ranchers should be happy that they're even considered a recognized nation to begin with. Anything more is like giving a cake to a rabbit." - the Lotharian delegation was quoted as saying." 
dvg_beornia.24.a: "Those ungrateful bastards! Also, what a bizarre analogy!"

dvg_beornia.25.t: "Edward's Dystopia"
dvg_beornia.25.d: "The recent industrial developments sponsored by the Edwardian regime has been followed by a considerable decline in the standard of living in the nation's capital, Camelot."
dvg_beornia.25.f: ""Daddy, daddy! Why does my skin look and feel funny?"\n \n"Son, I told you not to drink from the leaky engines or go swimming in Harold's Pond. Now we're going to have to *cough* wait a whole month before we can spend a year's salary at the doctor and so I can get some kind of replacement for my fingers falling off."" 
dvg_beornia.25.a: "Such is the beauty of our progress!"

dvg_beornia.26.t: "The New Carolean Course"
dvg_beornia.26.d: "Having ousted King Edward, the government of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has undergone a sweeping effort to undo the late king's ambitions and to restore the country to its original state."
dvg_beornia.26.f: ""Daddy, daddy! What is this book with its funny words?" \n \n "Son, put those books in the fireplace, they won't be of use anymore. We don't want the police to arrest us for witchcraft or end up further in debt now, do we? Now grab a pitchfork or two, we need to slay those Incans before they try to steal this month's supply of cattle again." " 
dvg_beornia.26.a: "Such is the beauty of our culture!"


dvg_hbe.1.t: "The Nightmare in the West"
dvg_hbe.1.d: "Much of Ameriga has now fallen under the rule of the Holy Britannian Emperor, who has made it clear he seeks to conquer the rest of the world next."
dvg_hbe.1.f: "Having already become an unstoppable force, everything the Britannians have said would happen has become true so far. Perhaps it could be wise to surrender?" 
dvg_hbe.1.a: "There is no such thing as an unstoppable force! This threat must be contained!"
dvg_hbe.1.b: "Maybe if we do nothing they won't notice us!"
dvg_hbe.1.c: "We can't possibly defeat them. We surrender! All hail Britannia!"
dvg_hbe.1.e: "The Holy Britannian Emperor shall be put out of his place!"

dvg_hbe.2.t: "Rule Britannia!"
dvg_hbe.2.d: "In the end, Britannia was truly able to conquer the world."
dvg_hbe.2.f: "Britannian superiority has been cemented. The prophecy is complete. It was almost as if our Emperor truly was able to forsee the future, as ridiculous as it once seemed." 
dvg_hbe.2.a: "Hello, world."

dvg_hbe.3.t: "The Doom of Camelot"
dvg_hbe.3.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] said that Beornia would be conquered, and so she was. Upon entering Camelot at the head of his army, he gave his soldiers only one order: “Surpass [concept_dvg_de_herrera]”."
dvg_hbe.3.f: "The Royal Palace was swiftly torched, with every member of the Beornian royal family captured and assembled before the [concept_dvg_sapa_inka]. After forcing them to bow and acclaim him as their sovereign, they were impaled before the smoldering remnants of their city's cathedral. The corpse of Prince Charles, the perpetrator of the raid that led to the war, was flayed alive publicly, with his skin being fashioned into a war drum and his skull gilded as Waskhar's personal drinking vessel.\n \nIn the aftermath of the conquest, Washkar sent out [concept_dvg_inka] officials throughout his new lands, promising the locals a quiet life if they obey the Imperial commandments, while reminding them of the fate reserved for rebels. European merchants have relayed the “Doom of Camelot” with horror, with many people in the Old Continent only now discovering that the city even existed. Now, all of [concept_dvg_ameriga] watches the south with fear, wondering where the fury of the Inka will strike next..." 
dvg_hbe.3.a: "God could not save their king!"

dvg_hbe.4.t: "The Rise of the Beornian Fundamentalists"
dvg_hbe.4.d: "When we defeated Beornia, we purged its barons to destroy their power, but this led to a power vacuum which was filled by prominent bishops and religious fundamentalists."
dvg_hbe.4.f: "Now a former Beornian army chaplain known only by the pseudonym [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_john_faith').GetFullName] has begun a series of armed pilgrimages across the region, advocating a violent, millenarian form of Anglican Christianity in order to restore Beornia. Seeking to bring back Anglican 'fundamentals', they glorify holy war and martyrdom claiming that the Day of Judgement is nigh and that both their country and Christ will return with it."
dvg_hbe.4.a: "Beornia needs to go back to its grave and stay dead!"
dvg_hbe.4.b: "Faith shall restore Beornia and march the righteous through Eden's Gate!"

dvg_hbe.5.t: "The Resurrection!"
dvg_hbe.5.d: "As order in the land between the Odon and the Andes collapses, Beornians from the entire country have taken up arms along with their leader, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_john_faith').GetFullName], who has entered Camelot on a white horse declaring the restoration of Beornia under the name 'Neo-Anglia' in reference to their European ancestors."
dvg_hbe.5.f: "Upon arriving in Camelot, John Faith rallied his followers once more: 'For our sake, Jesus Christ was crucified. For England's sake, St. Harold laid down his life. Now, our Beornia was conquered but it too is made resurrect from the ashes of the burnt Camelot! The Kingdom of the New Jerusalem has come! All hail the return of the holiest realm, a fortress of His true chosen people!'" 
dvg_hbe.5.a: "Arise, Neo-Anglia!"

dvg_hbe.6.t: "Ameriga Conquered!"
dvg_hbe.6.d: "To the shock of those who once ridiculed the formerly unknown backwater country, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has an unquestionable hegemony over the continent. Standing before his victorious soldiers, Emperor [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] makes a speech."
dvg_hbe.6.f: " "Our consistent victories across the continent are proof that all men ... are NOT created equal! Some are born swifter afoot, some with greater beauty, some are born into poverty and others born sick and feeble. Both in birth and upbringing, in sheer scope of ability every human is inherently different; Yes that is why people discriminate against one another, which is why there is struggle, competition, and the unfaltering march of progress. Inequality is not wrong, equality is. What of the Atlantians which made equality a right? Rabble politics by a popularity contest. The Communists with their equal distribution of wealth? Countries of lazy dullards. But not our beloved Britannia, we fight, we compete, evolution is continuous. Britannia alone moves forward, advancing steadily into the future! We will fight on, we shall struggle, compete, plunder, and dominate, and in the end..." " 
dvg_hbe.6.a: "The future shall be ours! The rest of the world shall kneel before us!"
dvg_hbe.6.b: "We have already won!"

dvg_hbe.7.t: "The End of the Holy Britannian Empire"
dvg_hbe.7.d: "As history has shown, all empires must come to an end eventually, and that has included the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. "
dvg_hbe.7.f: "With a combination of opposing foreign forces, internal collaborators, exiled dissidents, and a masked assassin known as 'Zero', the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is over. During a public event attempting to reassure his subjects about the state of the country, the Holy Britannian Emperor [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] had his own personal sword stolen from him by the renowned assassin and was subsequently stabbed to death by it. The crowd witnessing this spectacle cheers upon seeing the end of this despot. Hopefully nobody tries to resurrect him or anything he represented."
dvg_hbe.7.a: "The sun has finally set on the Britannian Empire!"
dvg_hbe.7.b: "With the death of the Emperor, Britannia can redefine itself!"

dvg_hbe.8.t: "The One Who Knocks"
dvg_hbe.8.d: "For many years now, a professor turned fugitive known as Weiss Heisenberg has been on the run from various governments across the West due to the many crimes believed to have been connected to him."
dvg_hbe.8.f: "One of his business partners from his days at the Univesity of Wuppertal has said 'I can't speak to this new Heisenberg that people refer to, but whatever he became, the sweet, kind, brilliant man that we once knew long ago. He's gone.' \n\n As of today, his alleged crimes include murder, theft, kidnapping, blackmail, and most notably the mass production and distribution of methamphetamine unlike any other. Recently, there has been reports of him in our country telling his pursuers 'I am not in danger, I am the danger!'  "
dvg_hbe.8.a: "He's not going to be in the money business or the meth business. He's going to be in the Empire business."
dvg_hbe.8.b: "On second thought, we shouldn't trust this guy. He'd probably kill a child!"

dvg_england.1.t: "The English Request our Aid"
dvg_england.1.d: "The English have revolted against the Dual Monarchy and requesting our aid."
dvg_england.1.f: "For many Anglicans, England has always been a 'Promised Land' as they see it as their ancestral home. This could be the first step towards putting our king on an English throne!" 
dvg_england.1.a: "We shall aid our bretheren across the sea!"
dvg_england.1.b: "We don't want to face the ire of the Dual Monarchy."

dvg_england.2.t: "Beornia Requests Yorkshire Estate"
dvg_england.2.d: "Beornia requests that their royal family be given ownership of the area around Newcastle, claiming they are descendants of the very same House Cavendish that ruled over the area. "
dvg_england.2.f: "" 
dvg_england.2.a: "Sure, they can have a few acres of land."
dvg_england.2.b: "We don't owe them anything!"


dvg_england.8.t: "Beornians Request a Summit"
dvg_england.8.d: "Following our recent independence, our distant relatives in Ameriga, the Beornians, have proposed for a summit for future cooperation."
dvg_england.8.f: "The ruling Cavendish family of Beornia claims descent from the very same Cavendish family that once ruled as dukes of Newcastle in Yorkshire. Although this claim is disputed by some scholars, perhaps we can leave an open mind for a fellow Anglophone sovereign state?" 
dvg_england.8.a: "Let's see what the Beornians want!"
dvg_england.8.b: "We do not have time to deal with this."

dvg_england.9.t: "England Accepts Summit!"
dvg_england.9.d: "As we had hoped for, the newly independent England is open for dialogue to discuss our future cooperation."
dvg_england.9.f: "It has been centuries since Beornians have become a seperate identity from the English, but surely we can still understand one another." 
dvg_england.9.a: "Hopefully we can keep calm and carry on."

dvg_england.10.t: "Failure of the Pan-Anglo Summit"
dvg_england.10.d: "Despite having a shared language and heritage, the cultural differences and conflicting political interests of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and England proved too great for unity."
dvg_england.10.f: "The English people in England were deemed 'too French' for the Beornian politicians who now have become more nationalist than before the summit. Meanwhile, those in England saw no reason to share governing power with or incorporate a far-removed distant land on another continent, preferring to limit the scope of their realm." 
dvg_england.10.a: "It's a long way to Picadily."

dvg_england.11.t: "The Question of Sovereignty"
dvg_england.11.d: "As we grow closer to cooperation, the question has arisen on how customs and sovereignty should be handled. "
dvg_england.11.f: "There are those in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] who believe that King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] should be the rightful ruler of all Anglophone people. Of course, this would be a very difficult sell to England, as most people there may not even be aware of our king's existence. We could also ask to be under their sovereignty instead, though this might upset some within our own country." 
dvg_england.11.a: "The people of England must accept the rule of a true English King, and that king just happens to be Beornian!"
dvg_england.11.b: "We are clearly in a lesser position. Let's accept being under England's rule."
dvg_england.11.c: "Nobody should have to hand over sovereignty to anybody. Maybe just a customs union?"
dvg_england.11.e: "Maybe we can be an autonomous territory under England?"

dvg_england.12.t: "A Beornian King Of England?"
dvg_england.12.d: "The Beornians have asked us to submit to the rule of their king."
dvg_england.12.f: "There are those in Beornia who believe that their King should be the rightful ruler of all English people. Obviously, this is a preposterous idea to even consider since many in England don't know of him or would even dispute the legitimacy of his noble lineage. Even if their ruling king really is the legitimate descendant of House Cavendish, that's only the claim to a duchy and not an entire kingdom. Still, there are a few reactionaries in Yorkshire who would might be pleased by this, though the rest of the country would feel differently." 
dvg_england.12.a: "Well, at least we would have a King that isn't French!"
dvg_england.12.b: "And replace one foreign monarch for another? No thanks."

dvg_england.13.t: "England Refuses Our King!"
dvg_england.13.d: "It seems for whatever reason the government in England decided against submitting to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] rule, even though the family lineage can be traced back there! "
dvg_england.13.f: "The delegates of England have called our proposal to be 'preposterous' and said they will not become the colony of an 'inbred backwater'. Obviously, this has gravely insulted the people of our nation." 
dvg_england.13.a: "We are not amused."

dvg_england.14.t: "English Reunited"
dvg_england.14.d: "After much deliberation, it seems Beornia and England can unite under a single crown."
dvg_england.14.f: "It seems in spite of the centuries and oceans separating them, England and Beornia can be one nation after all." 
dvg_england.14.a: "A United Kingdom of English-speakers! Long may it reign!"

dvg_england.15.t: "Beornia Wants To Be A Part of England!"
dvg_england.15.d: "The Beornians have asked to be put under our sovereignty as we are owners of their 'promised land'. "
dvg_england.15.f: "While we might not have much to lose by accepting their offer, what the relationship should be is still up for debate. Annexing them would give us more resources, but any potential problems there could spill over to the rest of our country." 
dvg_england.15.a: "We should be safe if we just keep them in our market, only as a protectorate."
dvg_england.15.b: "Maybe [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] really could rule the waves..."
dvg_england.15.c: "A dominion of Beornia sounds nice..."

dvg_england.16.t: "A Pan-Anglo Customs Union?"
dvg_england.16.d: "It seems neither the English nor the Beornians can agree on which country's leader should be the main sovereign. Therefore, a customs union was suggested as a compromise."
dvg_england.16.f: "This way, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can take advantage of Beornia's vast agricultural land and Beornia can gain all the perks of England's industrialization. Perhaps this sounds fair?" 
dvg_england.16.a: "We should not have to share a market with stupid 'Cattle Barons' and their ilk."
dvg_england.16.b: "God Save the Invisible Hand!"

dvg_england.17.t: "The Issue of Language and Citizenship"
dvg_england.17.d: "With our shared cultural heritage, the debate on how to handle our language and culture has come up."
dvg_england.17.f: "Beornia insists that we remove the 'French elements' from our culture and have English literacy be a requirement for citizenship. However, given our long rule under the Dual Monarchy, many within our borders speak French as a primary or secondary language and are even practicing Catholics as well. As such, while acquiescing with the Beornian demands may please them, it would disenfranchise a different part of our population." 
dvg_england.17.a: "We agree, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] must stay true to being English!"
dvg_england.17.b: "This is clearly impractical. We are all Britons!"

dvg_england.18.t: "England Refuses to Compromise on the French Question"
dvg_england.18.d: "Delegates from England have told us they refuse to disenfranchise a significant portion of their populace to appease us."
dvg_england.18.f: "Despite our own delegates' insistence they remove the 'French elements' from their culture and have English literacy be a requirement for citizenship, it seems they want to take a more liberal approach? Given their long rule under the Dual Monarchy, many within their borders speak French as a primary language and are follow Catholicism as the preferred faith. Some in our government wonder whether it is still worthwhile to cooperate with an England that is willing to compromise on its culture." 
dvg_england.18.a: "To be fair, we are foreigners in our own land too..."
dvg_england.18.b: "What even is the point if England isn't gonna be English?"

dvg_england.19.t: "England for the English"
dvg_england.19.d: "England has agreed to help purge French influence from their territory. "
dvg_england.19.f: "If there is anything we can bond our, it is that this world has too much Francophone already." 
dvg_england.19.a: "We are ever close to restoring England to its authentic self."

dvg_england.20.t: "England's Religion"
dvg_england.20.d: "Thanks to Plantegenet rule, the Catholic Church has a much more prevalent presence in England than any Protestant branch."
dvg_england.20.f: "Upon being independent however, there are nationalists within England and from Beornia to change the official state religion to be that of the Anglican Church, which preaches of England being a 'promised land' and to build a new 'Jerusalem' within its borders. However, changing faiths like this would alienate many Britons who are already Catholic." 
dvg_england.20.a: "We shall follow the prayers of London and Avalon, not Rome!"
dvg_england.20.b: "The Catholics have been, and always will be the true Christians!"
dvg_england.20.c: "Why choose between a state church when we can just be a secular country?"

dvg_england.21.t: "England Embraces the Anglican Church!"
dvg_england.21.d: "In order to appease more nationalist sentiments, England has opted to change their state religion away from Catholicism."
dvg_england.21.f: "Already, the heads of the Anglican Churches in Beornia and in England are calling for a meeting to discuss the further integration of their institutions. Already, the French and Latin names found in churches, on hospitals, schools, are being renamed into more English-sounding ones with 'Jerusalem' being considered for an English national anthem." 
dvg_england.21.a: "The language of prayer is the language of belief!"

dvg_england.22.t: "England Rejects the Anglican Church!"
dvg_england.22.d: "Rather than embracing the Anglican faith as their state religion, England has stuck to the same Catholic Church as its former overlord."
dvg_england.22.f: "Citing concerns about their relations with the rest of Europe and how much younger our church is, the government England says they fail to see our church's doctrine is legitimate enough for them to adopt. They say they will stick to the one true form of Christianity." 
dvg_england.22.a: "Clearly they're the heretics, not us!"

dvg_england.23.t: "England Decides to be Secular!"
dvg_england.23.d: "Unable to choose their state religion, England's government has announced they will be moving towards secularism instead and try to not favor any religion over the other."
dvg_england.23.f: "According to the Beornian delegates partaking in the summit, it was unclear if they were doing this as a way to distance themselves from us or their neighbors across the channel, or if they were going down a godless route. Instead, all they got were conflicting 'wishy-washy' answers that made it more unclear." 
dvg_england.23.a: "What is going on here?"


dvg_patagonia.1.t: "The Conquest of the Desert"
dvg_patagonia.1.d: "We have completed our long campaign to conquer the Patagonian south. Settlers are beginning to seek out promising sites from which to establish new towns and exploit the region's natural resources."
dvg_patagonia.1.f: ""The Mapuche fought long and hard for centuries to protect their country. Now at last they are defeated, and that land belongs to us. To the victor, the spoils. Now we must set ourselves to the task of populating and governing what we have won.""
dvg_patagonia.1.a: "At last, the south belongs to us."
dvg_patagonian_settlement: "Patagonian Settlement"
dvg_patagonia.2.t: "Arming the Natives"
dvg_patagonia.2.d: "We have discovered that our rivals in [SCOPE.sCountry('rival_country').GetName] have been arming the [SCOPE.sCountry('patagonia_country').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] natives in [SCOPE.sState('patagonia_state').GetName]. This is likely to impede our efforts to conquer the region."
dvg_patagonia.2.f: ""The [SCOPE.sCountry('patagonia_country').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] natives have never welcomed our presence, but without the means to mount a truly effective resistance we have paid little heed to their objections. The addition of [SCOPE.sCountry('rival_country').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] munitions into the equation comes with the frightening possibility that we must face them on equal terms.""
dvg_patagonia.2.a: "We should de-escalate the situation."
dvg_patagonia.2.b: "If they want a fight, they'll get one."
