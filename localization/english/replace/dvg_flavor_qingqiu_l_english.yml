 je_qingqiu_reform_into_cooler_federation:0 "Reforming the Federation"
 je_qingqiu_reform_into_cooler_federation_reason:0 "Through these reforms we will take control of the provincial armies and curb their corrupt ways by delegating more power to the people, this will allow our federation to prosper!"
 je_qingqiu_reform_into_unitary_state:0 "A New Era as a Unitary State"
 je_qingqiu_reform_into_unitary_state_reason:0 "The federal system has worked well in the past, yet the governors don't have the interests of the people in mind, by removing them from the equation we will be able to serve the people directly!"
 je_qingqiu_the_matter_of_the_leages:0 "League Matters"
 
 je_qingqiu_the_matter_of_the_leages_reason:0 "The Leagues of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], represented in the government as the united League of Traders, Shipwrights & Warehouses, rife with internal competition and many commercial ventures across the country, the Leagues are centralised around major trading cities in the country yet often extend their influence to the very frontiers of Qingqiu! This brings both benefits and pitfalls to the government, with their chokehold on almost all commercial aspects of the country, their business is our business too."

 je_mengzi:0 "The Resurgence of Mengzism"
 je_mengzi_desc:0 "Mengzism, or Mencianism, is a philosophical system based on the teachings of Mencius (Mengzi), a 4th-century BCE Chinese philosopher who is one of the most famous Confucian thinkers. Mengzism emphasizes the inherent goodness of human nature and the importance of cultivating this innate virtue through education, self-reflection, and moral development. It promotes the idea that people are born with a sense of compassion and righteousness, which can be nurtured to achieve moral excellence. Mengzism also advocates for benevolent governance, arguing that rulers should lead with virtue and prioritize the welfare of the people."
 
 je_fang_hu: "The Sanctioned Marshal"
 je_fang_hu_reason: "Yeng Futing himself tried to shape the country as he saw fit as the First Speaker but was out-maneuvered and left to conquer Hawaii. His efforts brought the decentralized archipelago under the rule of a wealthy Qingqiuese elite. As a Chinese-supermacist, he hopes to shape the archipelago in his own intersts."

 qingqiu_federation.1.t:0 "The Federation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 qingqiu_federation.1.d:0 "The Status of the Federation"
 qingqiu_federation.1.f:0 "The Federation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is by no means a well-functioning federation. Our provinces have a great level of autonomy, having differing laws and even their own armies, making governance from  difficult. The provinces are actively working against our federation, making it tough to pass laws and taking a share of the taxes imposed on our people for themselves! However the federation is not without benefits, with our long history of federalism, beginning in the 1600s, we have found what works for the Qingqiuan people. Yet now the question remains; We must reform, but how? Do we reform our federation, or begin a new era as a unitary state?"
 qingqiu_federation.1.a:0 "We must choose our path carefully"
 qingqiu_federation.2.t:0 "The Great Qingqiu Flood of 1862!"
 qingqiu_federation.3.t:0 "The Federation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 qingqiu_federation.3.d:0 "Success: A Reformed Federation"
 qingqiu_federation.3.f:0 "After years of careful manouvers within our government, pitting the provinces against each other and even considerate military reform in order to further our cause and prolong the success of the Federation! Now after years of struggles we have finally finished with our reforms, the provinces are now demilitarised and serve the people rather than the governors, our people no longer view themselves as Sanbaoers or Dayanites and instead see themselves as Qingqiuian! Now that we have bought stability to the federationn, we can continue onwards and face the enemies that dare threaten our Federation!"
 qingqiu_federation.3.a:0 "Our federation may live on for another century!"
 qingqiu_federation.4.t:0 "The State of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 qingqiu_federation.4.d:0 "Success: The end of the Federation"
 qingqiu_federation.4.f:0 "After years of careful manouvers within our government, we have successfully curbed the influence of the states, making the system functionally obsolete! Finally our nation will be stable, we have the oportunity to liberalise and progress, finally the Qingqiuian people won't need to bend the knee to corrupt governors and endure thier backwards ways. Direct governance from Sanbao begins now, in the name of the people!"
 qingqiu_federation.4.a:0 "We walk forwards into a new era, united as one!"
 qingqiu_flood.15.tt:0 "We can only hope that this is enough"
 qingqiu_federation.5.t:0 "Completion of the Cross-Dayan Railway!"
 qingqiu_federation.5.d:0 "After many weeks of hard and grueling work by our valiant builders, we've finally completed the railway across Dayan, linking Changfeng and Sanbao!"
 qingqiu_federation.5.f:0 "Weaving through the mountains, past the gold fields of Dayan and along the Grey River, stretches a band of wood and steel, seemlingly endless should you stand in the middle of it. As the first train begins its journey from Sanbao to Changfeng, our railway builders sit back in Sanbao, proudly looking down the line as the joint Golden Sleeper monuments are built in Sanbao and Changfeng. Now eager passangers and prospectors in Sanbao stand at the platform waiting for the next train to bring them to the goldfields out west, creating a new wave of migration in Qingqiu!"
 qingqiu_federation.5.a:0 "Onwards to Changfeng!"

 ###Wars###
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.1.t: "Tension on the Southern Border"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.1.d: "After the fall of Colombia to Spain the issue of the Spainish-Qingqiuan border has been a source of tension. Numerous Colombian revolutionaries escaped into our country since then and despite demands from Spain to repatriate them back to Spain we have so far ignored them."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.1.f: "However, recently a group of Lusitanian freedom fighters known as the Californios launched a series of attacks against Spanish California with the goal of freeing them from Spanish control. After the Spanish army was dispatched to eliminate them the Califorios retreated across the border into our territory leaving the Spanish fuming. We fear that Spain may declare war on us for the actions of these rebels. Right now we are trying to assure them that we had nothing to do with the attacks and peace is still the best option for our two countries."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.1.a: "I fear the Spanish will not be that considerate."
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.2.t: "The Issue of Qingqiu"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.2.d: "After we defeated Colombia, many of their revolutionaries fled north into the country of Qingqiu. Since then rebel groups have been hiding in Qingqiu and have been launching raids into New Spain to try and destabilize it. While we have been successful in repelling the raids, many in our government want to put an end to the raids permanently."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.2.f: "They have floated the idea of giving Qingqiu an ultimatum demanding the surrender of not only anyone associated with Colombia, but also lands all the way up to Yingzhou. Of course Qingqiu will most likely refuse, but that will give us an excuse to go to war with them. However, many in the region fear our continued expansion, Nouvelle-Orleans and Copenhagen have warned us that another war in the region may force them to fight against us, and the natives in Amergia seem poised to strike in the event of a war. Alternatively we can just continue to fight off raids, it's not like Qingqiu can really do anything against us and it’s more likely they will just collapse given enough time."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.2.a: "Send the ultimatum."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.2.b: "Forget about expanding north, just consolidate what we have."
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.3.t: "The Spanish Ultimatum"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.3.d: "As feared the Spanish government has sent us an ultimatum in regards to the tensions on the southern border. Unfortunately, their demands are completely unreasonable. Not only would we have to surrender anyone associated with Colombia, but we would also have to give back lands Spain lost in the Second Spanish-Japanese war."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.3.f: "We know that fighting against Spain will be a Herculean task, but Spain’s actions have earned them the animosity of many in the region. The Cadiens in the east equally fear the growth of the Spanish and may be willing to join us in a defensive alliance. Likewise we might be able to get into contact with the natives in Ameriga and get them to open a front in the south. Finally the country of Scandinavia should be able to threaten the Spanish navy. However, we may have to give Scandinavia a large concession for them to join us. Giving their people extraterritoriality and their merchants a preferred position in trade negotiations should be able to sway them, but would it be worth it to sell our soul to save the nation?"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.3.a: "Begin the Great Diplomatic offensive on equal terms."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.3.b: "Offer the concessions to Scandinavia, and reach out to the others as well."
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.4.t: "Qingqiu Proposes An Anti-Spanish Alliance"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.4.d: "We have received word that Qingqiu is under threat from Spain who wants to effectively shatter the country. In desperation Qingqiu is asking us to join them in an Anti-Spanish Alliance."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.4.f: "They have reasonably put forward that Spain’s actions show that they are not content with what they have and someday they will probably try to go to war with us later down the line. However, Spain is in a powerful position and we will need to decide, do we dare go up against Goliath and hope for the best?"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.4.a: "Accept the alliance."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.4.b: "Refuse the alliance."
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.5.t: "Qingqiu Proposes An Anti-Spanish Alliance"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.5.d: "We have received word that Qingqiu is under threat from Spain who wants to effectively shatter the country. In desperation Qingqiu is asking us to join them in an Anti-Spanish Alliance."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.5.f: "They argue that the growth of Spain in the New World threatens Scandinavia’s position on the world stage and that action has to be taken for the sake of balance in the world. This argument hasn’t really convinced many in government that such a war would be beneficial to us. Granted, Spain’s success against Colombia is somewhat worrying, but it’s not like they can really leverage that against us. How should we respond to the diplomat from Qingqiu?"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.5.a: "Yeah they need to be knocked down a peg."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.5.b: "We do not care for what Spain does in the New World."
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.6.t: "Qingqiu Offers Concession For An Anti-Spanish Alliance"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.6.d: "We have received word that Qingqiu is under threat from Spain who wants to effectively shatter the country. In desperation Qingqiu is asking us to join them in an Anti-Spanish Alliance."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.6.f: "They argue that the growth of Spain in the New World threatens Scandinavia’s position on the world stage and that action has to be taken for the sake of balance in the world. They have also offered us extraterritoriality for our citizens and a preferred trade status for our merchants if we join. Many in the government see this as an amazing opportunity to gain influence in the Eastern Pacific and it is not like we have to defeat Spain in Europe, all we have to do is prevent Qingqiu from falling. How should we respond to the diplomat from Qingqiu?"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.6.a: "You’re too kind Qingqiu of course we accept."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.6.b: "We do not care for what Spain does in the New World."
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.7.t: "Third Spanish Californian War"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.7.d: "Due to constant raids coming from Qingqiu by former Colombian revolutionaries, the Spanish government sent an ultimatum demanding the surrender of those revolutionaries along with territory as compensation. However, Qingqiu not only refused the ultimatum, but began a diplomatic offensive to create an Anti-Spanish Alliance to fight back against Spain."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.7.f: "With the deadline for the ultimatum passed Spain has declared war on Qingqiu with the goal of taking land all the way up to Yingzhou. The future existence of Qingqiu is now on the line and the country will surely throw everything they can into driving the Spanish back. This war will most likely test the entirety of the Spanish Empire and if it should fail in this war, then Spain will once again find itself in a similar position to 1836 with a decaying empire in the New World."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.7.a: "This century old humiliation will at last be avenged."

 dvg_hawaii.1.d:0 "Sitting isolated in the Pacific Ocean, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] sits in a vulnerable position."
 dvg_hawaii.1.f:0 "Marshal [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] is the rightful leader of both our humble archipelago of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetName]. Beginning as a general in the Qingqiuese War of Independence he led his armies to victory and secured independence for his homeland. Naturally he was soon elected to the position of First Speaker and worked towards strengthening [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetName]. However he was backstabbed by his rivals and soon found himself under investigation and his position as First Speaker under threat. Before he could be charged with anything he embarked to the islands of Hawaii at the time known as Jarlsbergs・yene in Europe and which was going through its own unification war. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] brought peace and stability to his new realm of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] which he has governed ever since. One of his first decrees was an embargo against traitorous [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetName] but last night a [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetAdjective] ship, the Dinggyuan, attempted to smuggle goods into [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]! Fortunately the virtuous Fleet-in-Exile drove them off but this is yet another reminder that we must not forget our dangerous position."

Kept under house arrest and tight surveillance except during major ceremonies control of the islands・ ・ruling・ families strengthened Futing・s rule. It appears that these security measures have finally failed. Last night, after what was according to an interrogated household servant, months of planning the Kalanikupules gathered their most precious belongings and subdued the guards posted to the night watch of their state-furnished palace. Stealing out into the night they were met at the shore by a launch from a ship which carried them away and allowed them to make a rapid escape before the Navy could even be notified. According to the lighthouse keeper who reported the incident the ship that bore them was flying the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] flag! This has led to rumors swirling that the whole thing was a [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective] plot!"

Beginning as the youngest general in [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetName] he secured his country's independence from the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_JAP').GetAdjective]. However, the resistance to his centralization forced him into exile. He fled to the islands of Hawai'i at the time known as Jarlsbergs・yene in Europe and which was going through its own unification wars. The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetAdjective]  general decimated the warring chiefs and their retinues establishing an oligarchy where only the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetAdjective]  officers had power. Futing claimed to be the only true ruler of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetName] although no one took him seriously. His unopposed rule lasted more than 40 years and already it seems that both the native Hawaians who have become increasingly radicalized due to the harsh treatments imposed by the Chinese oligarchy and the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_QIN').GetAdjective] settlers want some change in the islands.

It seems that he was right to be paranoid. Just before dawn this morning a strike force of three Scandinavian men-of-war pulled into Hilo harbor cannons blazing. In the confusion of the assault Scandinavian marines travelled north by boat away from the heat of the fighting then made landfall and snuck into the city. Just as Marshall Chen was informed of the invasion the marines ・ led by Prince '[SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_iolani').GetFullName]  ・ fought their way into the palace and took Chen by surprise as he was escaping. Chen died in a shootout in the palace gardens and soon [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SCA').GetAdjective]avian reinforcements arrived to secure the capital.
