 je_qingqiu_reform_into_cooler_federation:0 "Reforming the Federation"
 je_qingqiu_reform_into_cooler_federation_reason:0 "Through these reforms we will take control of the provincial armies and curb their corrupt ways by delegating more power to the people, this will allow our federation to prosper!"
 je_qingqiu_reform_into_unitary_state:0 "A New Era as a Unitary State"
 je_qingqiu_reform_into_unitary_state_reason:0 "The federal system has worked well in the past, yet the governors don't have the interests of the people in mind, by removing them from the equation we will be able to serve the people directly!"
 je_qingqiu_the_matter_of_the_leages:0 "League Matters"
 
 je_qingqiu_the_matter_of_the_leages_reason:0 "The Leagues of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], represented in the government as the united League of Traders, Shipwrights & Warehouses, rife with internal competition and many commercial ventures across the country, the Leagues are centralised around major trading cities in the country yet often extend their influence to the very frontiers of Qingqiu! This brings both benefits and pitfalls to the government, with their chokehold on almost all commercial aspects of the country, their business is our business too."

 je_mengzi:0 "The Resurgence of Mengzism"
 je_mengzi_desc:0 "Mengzism, or Mencianism, is a philosophical system based on the teachings of Mencius (Mengzi), a 4th-century BCE Chinese philosopher who is one of the most famous Confucian thinkers. Mengzism emphasizes the inherent goodness of human nature and the importance of cultivating this innate virtue through education, self-reflection, and moral development. It promotes the idea that people are born with a sense of compassion and righteousness, which can be nurtured to achieve moral excellence. Mengzism also advocates for benevolent governance, arguing that rulers should lead with virtue and prioritize the welfare of the people."
 
 je_fang_hu: "The Sanctioned Marshal"
 je_fang_hu_reason: "Yeng Futing himself tried to shape the country as he saw fit as the First Speaker but was out-maneuvered and left to conquer Hawaii. His efforts brought the decentralized archipelago under the rule of a wealthy Qingqiuese elite. As a Chinese-supermacist, he hopes to shape the archipelago in his own intersts."

 qingqiu_federation.1.d:0 "The Status of the Federation"
 qingqiu_federation.1.f:0 "The Federation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is by no means a well-functioning federation. Our provinces have a great level of autonomy, having differing laws and even their own armies, making governance from  difficult. The provinces are actively working against our federation, making it tough to pass laws and taking a share of the taxes imposed on our people for themselves! However the federation is not without benefits, with our long history of federalism, beginning in the 1600s, we have found what works for the Qingqiuan people. Yet now the question remains; We must reform, but how? Do we reform our federation, or begin a new era as a unitary state?"
 qingqiu_federation.1.a:0 "We must choose our path carefully"

 qingqiu_federation.3.f:0 "After years of careful manouvers within our government, pitting the provinces against each other and even considerate military reform in order to further our cause and prolong the success of the Federation! Now after years of struggles we have finally finished with our reforms, the provinces are now demilitarised and serve the people rather than the governors, our people no longer view themselves as Sanbaoers or Dayanites and instead see themselves as Qingqiuian! Now that we have bought stability to the federationn, we can continue onwards and face the enemies that dare threaten our Federation!"
 qingqiu_federation.3.a:0 "Our federation may live on for another century!"
 qingqiu_federation.4.t:0 "The State of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 qingqiu_federation.4.d:0 "Success: The end of the Federation"
 qingqiu_federation.4.f:0 "After years of careful manouvers within our government, we have successfully curbed the influence of the states, making the system functionally obsolete! Finally our nation will be stable, we have the oportunity to liberalise and progress, finally the Qingqiuian people won't need to bend the knee to corrupt governors and endure thier backwards ways. Direct governance from Sanbao begins now, in the name of the people!"
 qingqiu_federation.4.a:0 "We walk forwards into a new era, united as one!"
 qingqiu_flood.15.tt:0 "We can only hope that this is enough"
 qingqiu_federation.5.t:0 "Completion of the Cross-Dayan Railway!"
 qingqiu_federation.5.d:0 "After many weeks of hard and grueling work by our valiant builders, we've finally completed the railway across Dayan, linking Changfeng and Sanbao!"
 qingqiu_federation.5.f:0 "Weaving through the mountains, past the gold fields of Dayan and along the Grey River, stretches a band of wood and steel, seemlingly endless should you stand in the middle of it. As the first train begins its journey from Sanbao to Changfeng, our railway builders sit back in Sanbao, proudly looking down the line as the joint Golden Sleeper monuments are built in Sanbao and Changfeng. Now eager passangers and prospectors in Sanbao stand at the platform waiting for the next train to bring them to the goldfields out west, creating a new wave of migration in Qingqiu!"
 qingqiu_federation.5.a:0 "Onwards to Changfeng!"

 ###Wars###
 third_spanish_californian_war: "Third Spanish Californian War"
 ##QIN vs. Spain
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.1.t: "Tension on the Southern Border"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.1.d: "After the fall of Colombia to Spain the issue of the Spainish-Qingqiuan border has been a source of tension. Numerous Colombian revolutionaries escaped into our country since then and despite demands from Spain to repatriate them back to Spain we have so far ignored them."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.1.f: "However, recently a group of Lusitanian freedom fighters known as the Californios launched a series of attacks against Spanish California with the goal of freeing them from Spanish control. After the Spanish army was dispatched to eliminate them the Califorios retreated across the border into our territory leaving the Spanish fuming. We fear that Spain may declare war on us for the actions of these rebels. Right now we are trying to assure them that we had nothing to do with the attacks and peace is still the best option for our two countries."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.1.a: "I fear the Spanish will not be that considerate."
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.2.t: "The Issue of Qingqiu"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.2.d: "After we defeated Colombia, many of their revolutionaries fled north into the country of Qingqiu. Since then rebel groups have been hiding in Qingqiu and have been launching raids into New Spain to try and destabilize it. While we have been successful in repelling the raids, many in our government want to put an end to the raids permanently."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.2.f: "They have floated the idea of giving Qingqiu an ultimatum demanding the surrender of not only anyone associated with Colombia, but also lands all the way up to Yingzhou. Of course Qingqiu will most likely refuse, but that will give us an excuse to go to war with them. However, many in the region fear our continued expansion, Nouvelle-Orleans and Copenhagen have warned us that another war in the region may force them to fight against us, and the natives in Amergia seem poised to strike in the event of a war. Alternatively we can just continue to fight off raids, it's not like Qingqiu can really do anything against us and it’s more likely they will just collapse given enough time."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.2.a: "Send the ultimatum."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.2.b: "Forget about expanding north, just consolidate what we have."
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.3.t: "The Spanish Ultimatum"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.3.d: "As feared the Spanish government has sent us an ultimatum in regards to the tensions on the southern border. Unfortunately, their demands are completely unreasonable. Not only would we have to surrender anyone associated with Colombia, but we would also have to give back lands Spain lost in the Second Spanish-Japanese war."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.3.f: "We know that fighting against Spain will be a Herculean task, but Spain’s actions have earned them the animosity of many in the region. The Cadiens in the east equally fear the growth of the Spanish and may be willing to join us in a defensive alliance. Likewise we might be able to get into contact with the natives in Ameriga and get them to open a front in the south. Finally the country of Scandinavia should be able to threaten the Spanish navy. However, we may have to give Scandinavia a large concession for them to join us. Giving their people extraterritoriality and their merchants a preferred position in trade negotiations should be able to sway them, but would it be worth it to sell our soul to save the nation?"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.3.a: "Begin the Great Diplomatic offensive on equal terms."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.3.b: "Offer the concessions to Scandinavia, and reach out to the others as well."
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.4.t: "Qingqiu Proposes An Anti-Spanish Alliance"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.4.d: "We have received word that Qingqiu is under threat from Spain who wants to effectively shatter the country. In desperation Qingqiu is asking us to join them in an Anti-Spanish Alliance."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.4.f: "They have reasonably put forward that Spain’s actions show that they are not content with what they have and someday they will probably try to go to war with us later down the line. However, Spain is in a powerful position and we will need to decide, do we dare go up against Goliath and hope for the best?"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.4.a: "Accept the alliance."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.4.b: "Refuse the alliance."
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.5.t: "Qingqiu Proposes An Anti-Spanish Alliance"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.5.d: "We have received word that Qingqiu is under threat from Spain who wants to effectively shatter the country. In desperation Qingqiu is asking us to join them in an Anti-Spanish Alliance."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.5.f: "They argue that the growth of Spain in the New World threatens Scandinavia’s position on the world stage and that action has to be taken for the sake of balance in the world. This argument hasn’t really convinced many in government that such a war would be beneficial to us. Granted, Spain’s success against Colombia is somewhat worrying, but it’s not like they can really leverage that against us. How should we respond to the diplomat from Qingqiu?"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.5.a: "Yeah they need to be knocked down a peg."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.5.b: "We do not care for what Spain does in the New World."
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.6.t: "Qingqiu Offers Concession For An Anti-Spanish Alliance"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.6.d: "We have received word that Qingqiu is under threat from Spain who wants to effectively shatter the country. In desperation Qingqiu is asking us to join them in an Anti-Spanish Alliance."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.6.f: "They argue that the growth of Spain in the New World threatens Scandinavia’s position on the world stage and that action has to be taken for the sake of balance in the world. They have also offered us extraterritoriality for our citizens and a preferred trade status for our merchants if we join. Many in the government see this as an amazing opportunity to gain influence in the Eastern Pacific and it is not like we have to defeat Spain in Europe, all we have to do is prevent Qingqiu from falling. How should we respond to the diplomat from Qingqiu?"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.6.a: "You’re too kind Qingqiu of course we accept."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.6.b: "We do not care for what Spain does in the New World."
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.7.t: "Third Spanish Californian War"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.7.d: "Due to constant raids coming from Qingqiu by former Colombian revolutionaries, the Spanish government sent an ultimatum demanding the surrender of those revolutionaries along with territory as compensation. However, Qingqiu not only refused the ultimatum, but began a diplomatic offensive to create an Anti-Spanish Alliance to fight back against Spain."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.7.f: "With the deadline for the ultimatum passed Spain has declared war on Qingqiu with the goal of taking land all the way up to Yingzhou. The future existence of Qingqiu is now on the line and the country will surely throw everything they can into driving the Spanish back. This war will most likely test the entirety of the Spanish Empire and if it should fail in this war, then Spain will once again find itself in a similar position to 1836 with a decaying empire in the New World."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.7.a: "This century old humiliation will at last be avenged."
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.8.t: "The Treaty of Veracruz"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.8.d: "The people of Qingqiu knew it was an almost impossible task, but they knew that they had to fight to save their nation. However, it was all futile in the end as Spain emerged victorious over the Qingqiuan. The resulting peace was harsh as Qingqiu was forced to give up all land along the coast up to the southern peninsula of the Bay of Sanbao."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.8.f: "Not only that, the eastern border of Qingqiu would now be placed along a river that flows from the Pahranagat Valley. Finally the lands of the Pueblo-Hohakam and Ute people shall be put under Spanish control. This has completely shattered the trust the provinces had in the central government of Qingqiu and all the major provinces have seceded forming their own governments. With this Spain has completely undone the damage caused by the Spanish-Japanese Wars and has now cemented its empire in Arcadia."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.8.a: "This is it, this is the end…"
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.9.t: "The Administration of Reclaimed Californian Lands"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.9.d: "With our overlord’s victory over Qingqiu they have naturally decided to hand the territory from Qingqiu to us."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.9.f: "We have set up local administrations in these areas and are ready for the additions to our existing lands."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.9.a: "Praise the lord!"
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.10.t: "The Reclamation of Californian Lands"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.10.d: "Our war against Qingqiu has gone splendidly. We have utterly defeated them and have forced them to agree to our harsh terms. Qingqiu has been forced to give up all land along the coast up to the southern peninsula of the Bay of Sanbao. Not only that, the eastern border of Qingqiu would now be placed along a river that flows from the Pahranagat Valley."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.10.f: "Finally the lands of the Pueblo-Hohakam and Ute people shall be put under our control. With their defeat sealed Qingqiu has completely shattered and should no longer pose a threat to us in the region. At long last our Empire has recovered from the humiliation that the Japanese caused us and we have restored our Empire in the New World in full!"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.10.a: "Plus Ultra!"
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.11.t: "The Treaty of Porto del Rey"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.11.d: "The Spanish tyrants have been vanquished by the arms of liberty! The world thought that Qingqiu would crumble before the Spanish colossus, but with the help of the gallant Colombian revolutionaries, we have cast down their despotism. The Spanish government accepted their fate and met with representatives from Qingqiu and their alliance in Porto del Rey."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.11.f: "Qingqiu’s new border now follows in part from the Rio Concepcion in the west to the Rio Grande in the east. The most important part of the treaty is the clause which has abrogated all Spanish claims in mainland Arcadia, placing New Spain in the hands of the revolutionaries. Though some diehard Colombian nationalists sought a restoration of Vicente’s planned union, most have accepted the division of New Spain along regional lines. With this, Spain has once again lost control of Arcadia, but this time it shall forever remain out of their grasp."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.11.a: "Like Dom Quixote, just a foolish old man and his rusty lance."
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.12.t: "The Independence of New Spain"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.12.d: "Our overlord’s loss in the recent war has finally granted us freedom."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.12.f: "Unfortunately, regionalist sentiments have resulted in the collapse of our country outside of the main government center."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.12.a: "We are broken, but we are at least free."
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.13.t: "The Administration of New Land"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.13.d: "We have done what many considered impossible and triumphed over the armies of Spain. With total defeat apparent, the Spanish government has been forced to meet with representatives from Qingqiu and their alliance in the city of Porto del Rey. After much debate it has been decided that the Colombian part of California shall be seceded to Qingqiu."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.13.f: "Not only that but Colombia will also give the Cunmin League all of its claimed lands in the north of New Spain. Qingqiu’s new border now follows in part from the Rio Concepcion in the west to the Rio Grande in the east. However, the harshest part of the treaty is Spain giving up control of the territory of New Spain and allowing the Colombian Revolutionaries to move back and set up their own governments which seem content to let the idea of a united Colombia die in favor of regional interests. The successful defense of Qingqiu has brought forth a new sense of purpose and many in the country feel ready to face any challenge in the future."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.13.a: "We did it! I can’t believe we did it!"
 
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.14.t: "The Treaty of Sanbao"
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.14.d: "Despite fierce fighting from both Qingqiu and Spain, neither side has been able to achieve a decisive victory over the other. With the war becoming unpopular in Spain, the Spanish government finally sent an offer to negotiate to end the war."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.14.f: "After much debate about possible land exchanges, in the end it was decided that the border between the two countries shall remain where it was before the war and any claims Spain had on Qingqiu shall be renounced. Politically for Spain the war is seen as an embarrassment, but at least the Spainish Empire as it stands is safe. As for Qingqiu, the successful defense of the country has brought forth a new sense of purpose and many in the country feel ready to face any challenge in the future."
 dvg_qingqiu_spain.14.a: "At least we know we are equal to the powers of Europe."

However he was backstabbed by his rivals and soon found himself under investigation and his position as First Speaker under threat. Before he could be charged with anything he embarked to the islands of Hawaii at the time known as Jarlsbergs・yene in Europe and which was going through its own unification war. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] brought peace and stability to his new realm of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] which he has governed ever since.

Stealing out into the night they were met at the shore by a launch from a ship which carried them away and allowed them to make a rapid escape before the Navy could even be notified.
