 dvg_japan.1.t:0 "A New Shogun?"
 dvg_japan.1.d:0 " Tenno (Emperor) [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] was crippled in a failed assassination attempt and is now confined to his bed and rarely conscious. He is only in his fifties and he is likely to live for decades more. "
 dvg_japan.1.f:0 "Abdication has almost never occured in Japan and even if that was an option his heir, [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir_scope').GetFirstName] , is a one-year-old baby. Thus Prince [SCOPE.sCharacter('neoshogun_scope').GetFirstName], Komei’s brother has assumed the position of Sessho-no-miya or Prince Regent. [SCOPE.sCharacter('neoshogun_scope').GetFirstName] was already the Daiko-Daijin or Great Chancellor of the Daijo-Kan or Great Council of the Imperial Court. The Great Council was reformed following the Imperial merger with the bakufu but [SCOPE.sCharacter('neoshogun_scope').GetFirstName] seems intent on using it to claim even more power. [SCOPE.sCharacter('neoshogun_scope').GetFirstName], nicknamed the "Neo-Shogun" has gained rapid support among Japanese traditionalists-who seek to defend the “kokutai” a complex phrase describing Japan’s national and cultural sovereignty-and has even begun to be referred to by his reformist and moderate opponents as a Neo-Shogun."
 dvg_japan.1.a:0 "We shall keep a close eye on him."
 dvg_japan.2.t:0 "Return of Admiral Yusumoto"
 dvg_japan.2.d:0 "A retainer of the Date clan, Admiral Yusumoto Hideki is deeply connected to Japan’s colonial endeavors in northwestern Arcadia. A strong proponent of the Hokkaiganese fur trade and a specialist in amphibious warfare Yusumoto was the only surviving admiral of the Xiazhou Expedition the ill-fated attempt to reconquer Qingqiu."
 dvg_japan.2.f:0 " Owing to his familiarity with the region Yusumoto volunteered to lead a team of Japanese marines to disable Qingqiuan naval defenses but despite his heroic efforts the marines under his command were encircled and destroyed. For this he faced exile and began travelling throughout the New World and Europe. He has written much during these travels and these writings have finally been published after his return to Japan as the Travel Commentaries of Yusumoto Hideki. While a fascinating picture of the ways of other nations the book also contains Yusumoto’s ruminations on the failure of Xiazhou his arguments and suggestions for reforming the military and some rather liberal statements on egalitarianism."
 dvg_japan.2.a:0 "The national military must never be hostile to reason."

 dvg_japan.3.t:0 "The Military Question"
 dvg_japan.3.d:0 "[SCOPE.sCharacter('renegade_scope').GetFullName]'s return to Japan and the publication of his Travel Commentaries has ignited a firestorm of controversy all centered around the military."
 dvg_japan.3.f:0 "The reformists argue that it was Western aid which tipped the scales in Qingqiu’s favor and thus Japan should adopt Western tactics and weapons. Most daimyos sympathize with Yusumoto and support some military reforms to avoid another Xiazhou catastrophe. Traditionalists support the proposal of the tozama or “outside” daimyo a group of nobles who were the last to submit to Nobunaga who have proposed to allow samurai status to be earned through victory on the battlefield while stripping mediocre samurai of their statuses effectively making the samurai a meritocracy. Prince Regent [SCOPE.sCharacter('neoshogun_scope').GetFirstName] has blamed Xiazhou’s failure on a lack of morale and purpose for the bushi and agrees that meritocracy could revitalize them. Debate about the Military Question has begun to rage across the nation."
 dvg_japan.3.a:0 "All this because of an admiral and his book?"

 dvg_japan.4.t:0 "Imperial Declaration on Military Development"
 dvg_japan.4.d:0 "The Military Question has become impossible for the Daijo-Kan to ignore and the time has come to decide the future of the Japanese armed forces."
 dvg_japan.4.f:0 "There are three general options. First the Daijo-Kan could support the tozama daimyo’s proposal to impose meritocracy upon the samurai an idea which the Sessho-no-miya prefers since it would ensure the preservation of the samurai in some form. Second they could draft a reform to slowly eliminate the samurai class replacing them with a professional officer corps but without any sudden shocks to Japanese military organization. Finally they could embrace the radicals’ proposal to hire advisors from Europe to teach the military the lessons learned from the Great German Wars as well as familiarize them with modern European weapons. What shall become of the Japanese military?"
 dvg_japan.4.a:0 "The best commanders of Europe shall teach us their ways"

 dvg_japan.5.t:0 "The Osaka Incident"
 dvg_japan.5.d:0 "Japan’s malaise has led to increasing violence by reformists."
 dvg_japan.5.f:0 "In reaction a traditionalist group whose name and motto is Sonno Joi or  “Revere the Emperor Expel the Barbarians” has formed supporting Neo-Confucianism and a Sakoku or “closed country” policy. Even some traditionalists view them as a nuisance since Western trade and technology are critical for us but some of the bushi admire Sonno Joi. These samurai have now caused trouble in Osaka the most important city of Japan--its primary trade port one of only three free trade ports along with Yokohama and Nagasaki and with less powers for the Gaikoku Bugyo foreign policy magistrates. This all has led to it possessing a large foreigner community. Yesterday a small number of Sonno Joi samurai attacked the Anglois Merchants’ Association killing a trader named Samuel Gallois. A crackdown was immediately launched against the Sonno Joi on the order of  [SCOPE.sCharacter('neoshogun_scope').GetFirstName] to forestall Western retaliation but the trade question has seized the nation."
 dvg_japan.5.a:0 "A poor way to revere the emperor."

 dvg_japan.6.t:0 "Trial of the Osaka Four"
 dvg_japan.6.d:0 "While the Sonno Joi movement has been curtailed across the nation there is still the matter of Gallois’ murderers"
 dvg_japan.6.f:0 "Four samurai known to either belong to the Sonno Joi movement or support it--Sakuma Taketo Fukuhara Hashimoto Sanai Echigo and Akane Shozan --appear to have been the orchestrators of the Osaka Incident. The Imperial judges in Osaka have found all four guilty of murder and the Dual Monarchy was content with the verdict and reparations offered by the Imperial Court. The main question is whether the samurai will be allowed to commit seppuku to keep their honor or if we wish to have them executed as commoners to show the severity of the judgement and perhaps send a message about the future of the samurai class if such events occur again."
 dvg_japan.6.a:0 "To the gallows with them!"
 dvg_japan.6.b:0 "Allow them an honorable death"


 dvg_japan.7.t:0 "Imperial Declaration on Kaikoku Law"
 dvg_japan.7.d:0 "The Osaka Incident has inspired the various proponents of Kaikoku or “open country” policy to come together to try to change the official policy concerning the opening of the country to foreign trade putting pressure on the Daijo-Kan to act."
 dvg_japan.7.f:0 "Currently only Osaka is freely open to foreign trade while controlled by Imperial functionaries. This excludes the leased ports of Yokohama and Nagasaki which have become foreign enclaves. For many daimyo further opening to trade would allow them to modernize their domains and thus there is a strong movement to open the country even more. Moderates advise a middle ground gradually expanding foreign access to Japan and loosening trade restrictions but preserving aspects of state control and supervision. However the growth of the Sonno Joi movement has left a mark on our nation and even after its curtailment there are those who believe its adherents had good ideas about preserving national integrity. What shall become of Japanese trade laws?"
 dvg_japan.7.a:0 "Kaikoku must be expanded to bring prosperity to our country!"
 dvg_japan.7.b:0 "The current system must cautiously evolve."
 dvg_japan.7.c:0 "Sonno Joi had a point- Kaikoku needs to be reversed."


 dvg_japan.8.t:0 "Question of Sandakan"
 dvg_japan.8.d:0 "As the Japanese interests in the Indies has grown, the question has arisen on what kind of colony Sandakan should be."
 dvg_japan.8.f:0 "As the Japanese no longer control much of the Arcadian coast as it used to while the demands of the industrial revolution grew greater, it sought colonies further south. The first of which was Sandakan- a town on Borneo seized by Wokou operating under the Otomo (or some other) clan, who have now been forced to swear fealty to the Emperor. \n\n Demographcially, the colony is very different from mainland Japan - with the heavy presence of Malay merchants, European missionaries, and Chinese labourers. While they must be subservient to the Emperor either way, the group whose interests we choose to appease will define the colonial policies."
 dvg_japan.8.a:0 "Sandakan was Malay - and should remain so in some capacity. If we want local resources we should have good local relations."    
 dvg_japan.8.b:0 "Sandakan can be a bridge between the East and the West! Maybe the real riches are the  European knowledge we'll get along the way."
 dvg_japan.8.c:0 "Sandakan cannot hope to sustain itself without Chinese labor. Extracting resources from the Indies efficiently has always been the purpose of this colony."
 dvg_japan.8.e:0 "Sandakan will be the stepping stone to spreading Japanese culture in the Indies - supported by Japanese workers, settlers, and administrators."

 dvg_japan.9.t:0 "The Sadao Affair"
 dvg_japan.9.d:0 "The growth of Japanese religious nationalism has given rise to “State Shinto” an informal system of government-supported Shintoism."
 dvg_japan.9.f:0 "This favoritism has caused an issue in Hiroshima due to a printer named Sadao Aoko. Owning one of the city’s largest presses he made a fortune printing Western books at cheap prices. Towards the end of his life he sought spiritual advice from Buddhists Catholics and Shintoists. Sadao recently died and he willed his shop to three different temples-Buddhist Catholic and Shinto! Samurai belonging to each religion entered the city to defend their faith’s claim to the shop. After a riot in front of the shop all bushi involved were arrested. Imperial judges awarded the shop to the Shintoists but religious tensions are inflamed while the Spanish government lodged a complaint since one bushi was apparently a Jesuit!"
 dvg_japan.9.a:0 "Our religious situation is growing perilous!"
 
 dvg_japan.10.t:0 "Imperial Declaration on Religion"
 dvg_japan.10.d:0 "The Sadao Affair represents a dangerous recurrence not seen in many years a clash of samurai not over Japan’s government but over matters of faith and one which has begun to open up old wounds across the country."
 dvg_japan.10.f:0 "If we want to avoid being ripped apart by religious turmoil like so many Western nations then we must determine a national religious policy. Three options are before the Daijo-Kan."
 dvg_japan.10.a:0 "The only path to religious peace is religious freedom!"
 dvg_japan.10.b:0 "We shall support State Shinto but other faiths will be tolerated!"
 dvg_japan.10.c:0 "Shinto is supreme and the emperor's divinity is undeniable!"

 # Reformists seek to establish true freedom of religion throughout Japan creating protections against religious discrimination to prevent sectarianism. Moderates want to formally establish support for State Shinto but also want to establish limited religious pluralism to avoid unnecessary conflict. Finally the traditionalists in their quest to uphold the kokutai demand extensive support for State Shinto and the explicit confirmation by law of the emperor’s status as a living kami deifying him. What shall become of Japanese religion?

 dvg_japan.11.t:0 "The Education of the Imperial Prince"
 dvg_japan.11.d:0 "The question of a national education policy and the question of the heir's education have become linked. Whichever method we choose to use for him shall shape him as a ruler and signal to the people our preferred course for Japanese education."
 dvg_japan.11.f:0 "Within the Daijo-Kan reformists have proposed to scour Europe for the finest scholars and invite them to Kyoto to ensure that the Prince receives the most modern education possible. Moderates have suggested that scholars from the Yosho Shirabesho a new school and research center in Edo founded by a group of famous academics to use Western literature and methods in a Japanese context should be brought to educate the heir. Finally Prince Regent  [SCOPE.sCharacter('neoshogun_scope').GetFirstName] has declared that as he is kin of the emperor and thus “blessed by the kami” he should educate the heir and it is likely that he would rely heavily on the traditionalists to aid him. What shall become of Japanese education?"
 dvg_japan.11.a:0 "We need a new vision - bring foreign preceptors to Kyoto!"
 dvg_japan.11.b:0 "The Yosho Shirabesho shall teach next Emperor in a balanced way."
 dvg_japan.11.c:0 "The blessed Prince Regent  [SCOPE.sCharacter('neoshogun_scope').GetFirstName] shall instruct the heir personally."

 dvg_japan.12.t:0 "Imperial Declaration on Guilds and Corporations"
 dvg_japan.12.d:0 "The issue has reached the Imperial Court and the Great Council must decide the fate of the Japanese economy."
 dvg_japan.12.f:0 " ‘Raikichi-Raikuza’ or ‘Free markets and Open guilds’ written by [SCOPE.sCharacter('daimyo_scope').GetFullName] Osaka’s eccentric daimyo. In it [SCOPE.sCharacter('daimyo_scope').GetLastName] declares that Nobunaga sought to rebalance the Japanese economy through ‘Raikichi-rakuza’ placing urban economies into the hands of local merchants rather than guilds. This originated from the daimyo Rokakku Sayadori of Omi Province in the town of Ishidera during the Sengoku. Rokakku dissolved the rakuza of Ishidera granting exclusive sales and non-taxation rights to local merchants and tradesmen. This transformed the town into a trade hub and the practice spread across Japan. However it also fed a growing black market in order to meet rising demand. [SCOPE.sCharacter('daimyo_scope').GetLastName] concludes by arguing that these daimyo were the forerunners of liberalism. The book has become popular as people seek new financial solutions during the recession much to the guilds’ ire."
 dvg_japan.12.a:0 "Market liberalism has always been Japanese"
 dvg_japan.12.b:0 "We must find and form new corporations to challenge the West"
 dvg_japan.12.c:0 "The guilds must evolve but remain relevant on their own accord."

  #Reformists proclaim Mizuno to be the prophet of a free-market rebirth that Japan should embrace. Moderates propose the creation of state-supported corporations to replace the guilds but without sacrificing state influence over the economy. Finally traditionalists argue that the guilds are a cornerstone of Japan and that they should be helped to modernize and reform themselves to keep the economy running smoothly not be discarded. What shall become of the Japanese economy?

 dvg_japan.13.t:0 "The Obama Uprising"
 dvg_japan.13.d:0 " An incident has occurred in the town of Obama located on the northern coast and ruled by the Sakai clan who have been eager participants in maritime trade."
 dvg_japan.13.f:0 "Japan is no stranger to peasant insurrections as rural communities periodically find themselves driven to violence in order to protest tyrannical officials or to resist taxation. The Sakai have raised higher and higher taxes on the town’s fishermen in order to attract trade via low import fees. When it was announced that taxes would be increased for the third time in three weeks the fishermen finally snapped. Wielding fishing spears and sailor’s knives they stormed and torched the tax collector’s office before ransacking the merchant district touching off a general riot and extensive looting before Sarai samurai finally restored order. Disturbingly this occurred within the Imperial domain and the bushi report that the fishermen not only shouted Jiyuto slogans but even called for the overthrow of the monarchy!"
 dvg_japan.13.a:0 "Thanks Obama!"

 dvg_japan.14.t:0 "Drama in the Daijo-Kan"
 dvg_japan.14.d:0 "Tensions between Sessho-no-miya  [SCOPE.sCharacter('neoshogun_scope').GetFirstName] and the rest of the Great Council have finally erupted over the question of national security."
 dvg_japan.14.f:0 " [SCOPE.sCharacter('neoshogun_scope').GetFirstName] is convinced that the Obama Uprising proves that a vast conspiracy exists between liberals and newly insurgent republicans to overthrow and dissolve the Empire and replace it with a Western democratic clique. He therefore demands nothing less than an immediate and nationwide purge of the Jiyuto. Although much of the council has grown to distrust the movement and agree that the republicans must be arrested they and many other daimyo worry that giving  [SCOPE.sCharacter('neoshogun_scope').GetFirstName] such a sweeping mandate could be used by the Prince Regent as a pretext to claim absolute power and crush all checks to his rule. Reformists argue that the government should focus on addressing legitimate grievances rather than seeking someone to blame while the moderates support limited arrests with public gestures to reaffirm Imperial authority. Traditionalists however, are ready to strike and await  [SCOPE.sCharacter('neoshogun_scope').GetFirstName]’s command."
 dvg_japan.14.a:0 "The issues raised by the liberals ring true, and we must address them."
 dvg_japan.14.b:0 "A few arrests of troublesome bushi will restore order"

All classes high and low shall be united in the fulfillment of their promises to Our Imperial Ancestors just as We shall fulfill Our promise to the people to bestow upon them their Natural rights. And it is through assemblies of sagacious deliberation that the rights of the people shall be expressed.” The day that liberals dreamed of and traditionalists feared has finally arrived as the Meiji Emperor heralds the advent of Japanese democracy.

With the legitimacy of Tenno Showa now beyond all reasonable doubt, Japan may finally turn its attention and its energies to its borders. We shall prove ourselves worth of the glory which the Heavens have bestowed upon us!"
 dvg_japan.22.f2:0 "Victory! We have defeated the despicable kinslayer who dared to call himself “Emperor Showa,” as well as the militant republicans. Prince Konoe has been enthroned as Emperor, taking the regnal name of Heisei, or “Peace Everywhere.” This name is indeed a great longing for the Japanese people, who wish to restore harmony after decades of chaos. Considering this, Emperor Heisei has proven to be a greater ally of the reformists than many expected, promising to work with them and even proclaiming the formation of an Imperial Parliament. While Heisei has claimed to oppose radicalism, the fact that he has left much of Koshi’s Great Reform in place has shocked many conservatives, though the bushi’s defeat seems to have shattered their political power. Most of his subjects can hardly complain about having a pragmatic Emperor, considering his predecessor. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike are looking towards the future with renewed hope. Perhaps the unity which has been so out of reach in years past may finally be at hand?"
 dvg_japan.22.f3:0 "Victory! The bushi have defied the odds and created a bold new Japanese Republic. Across the nation, commoner and daimyo alike behold a nation in the hands of its greatest defenders. The first order of business was the public execution of the false kinslaying emperor-Showa might have thought himself blessed by Heaven, but the executioner’s blade and the crematorium thought otherwise. This has been taken badly by those already reeling from one Imperial death, creating instability. Furthermore, many reformists seem wary of a revolution imposed by the bushi. Tragically, Admiral Yusumoto perished in battle, leaving his successors to guide the nation. His lieutenant, Saigo Ryoma, has been appointed President pending new elections. Few would have imagined samurai leading the revolution, but we have realized our true role as the stewards of Japan, and we shall both advance its interests and protect its heritage. Under the firm yet benevolent hand of democracy, Japan shall reap untold riches."

Having led a group of liberals into the northern mountains to escape the previous government’s violent purge of reformists Nomura only grew more radical in isolation. Upon return his advocacy for social and gender equality made him many enemies yet also led some to see Nomura as the last true republican. His base of support is the city of Edo where officials had noted with concern the growing membership among workers in Nomura’s so-called “Free Press Party” a group which has long been suspected as being a front for much more serious radicalism. This proved correct as Nomura and a small army of followers have taken advantage of a small-scale dockworker strike to launch a rebellion! Armed cadres have seized control of Edo and stormed city hall where Nomura has read a speech in which he has denounced the government as “the boot stamping upon the necks of the people” and called for revolution! The revolt is already spreading beyond Edo..."

 dvg_expedition.253.f:0 "As the rocks tumbled down the mountain, snow cascading in their wake, blood dripped over the ledge where a struck expeditionary lay. The steam escaping his split lips were the only sign of life from the poor boy.

 dvg_expedition.260.d:0 "Some members of the expedition have expressed concern that the weather is turning against them. They insist on hunkering down to avoid the worst of it."
 dvg_expedition.260.f:1 ""The layers of snow kept growing like untreated tumors. A huge white, a great white, and the reflection of it making our eyes sore and hurt. If we don't stop now, maybe we won't be able to stop anymore. One of the men shivers as he rubs his arms — lips as pale as our shadow over the snow. He doesn't say a word.""

 dvg_expedition.262.d:0 "Unfortunately the expedition got caught in a snow storm, a few members died and several supplies were lost."
 dvg_expedition.262.f:0 ""Poor visibility, biting cold and on top of it all the gnawing feeling that I had made an error of judgment.""
 dvg_expedition.262.a:0 "Unfortunate."

 dvg_expedition.263.t:0 "Snow Clears"
 dvg_expedition.263.d:0 "After a while the snow has subsided enough to push on."

Fascinating! And certainly lucrative.""

But only so small that the risk is desirable.\n\nThe smell is, however, familiar. A childhood in the countryside. Summer, most certainly. At dawn, or perhaps at dusk. The former, yes, at dusk. I saw bright colors in the fields, poison, the other kids screamed, those plants were venomous. The eyes of the expedition members, ah, their eyes fixated on the flowers.""

 dvg_expedition.280.f:1 ""I recognized the markings that we had left on a triangular shaped rock. We kept walking as I decided to not mention them, but for the whispers among the members and their unsettling eyes I was sure that they also knew.\n\nWe walk through the forest like autumn leaves, broken branches, uncared for stray animals; those kids in fairytales, sent to the woods by evil step-mothers. A circle is a circle is a circle.""

 dvg_expedition.282.d:0 "The expedition managed to find the correct trail again and have set off, losing relatively little time."
 dvg_expedition.282.f:0 ""We picked a direction, almost at random. Good thing it turned out to be the right one.""
 dvg_expedition.282.a:0 "Great News"

 dvg_expedition.501.t:0 "The Ill Intent?"
 dvg_expedition.501.d:0 "For the past few days, some expedition members cannot help but shake the feeling that they are being followed."
 dvg_expedition.501.f:0 ""We were making our way through the mist...when I started hearing the foliage moving. I went to the nearest bush, but saw no animal nor person there.\n\n We continued walking, and then one of our other members started yelling about the trees speaking a strange language...""
 dvg_expedition.501.a:0 "Stay put, make sure you know what's going on."
 dvg_expedition.501.b:0 "You're just being too paranoid, no need to worry!"

 dvg_expedition.502.t:0 "Highway Robbery"
 dvg_expedition.502.d:0 "The fears of the expedition members were realized as a group of bandits surrounded and looted them of their belongings."
 dvg_expedition.502.f:0 "These guys were really thorough. They made sure to take as much of our supplies as they could carry! We might not be able to make it through another week...""
 dvg_expedition.502.a:0 "Make do with what is left."
 dvg_expedition.502.b:0 "Clearly this expedition needs another reimbusement."
