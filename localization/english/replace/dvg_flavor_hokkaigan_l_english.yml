je_kaiganese_refugee_crisis_reason: "The consequences following the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Japanese loyalists from Qingqiu have only now truly begun to rear their head. The only thing to do now is to cautiously observe the resulting chaos while it plays out until a solution presents itself."

je_kaigan_qingqiu_war: "The Buyeo Border Crisis"
je_kaigan_qingqiu_war_reason: "It's only a matter of time before the Third Fuso War begins. Ever since the disaster at the Battle of Baishan, the border between Hokkaigan and Qingqiu was drawn at the city's outskirts, more or less a transient region held by neither Japan nor Qingqiu fully. The result is that this entire region, a place the Qingqiuans now refer to as "Buyeo", a place inhabited primarily by the descendents of indentured Korean servants during the Fuso colony, is now the flashpoint of tensions between the two powers. The native Buyeoans caught in the middle are forced to prepare for their home to become the frontline in the inevitable conflict to come."

dvg_hokkaigan.3.f: "1836 marks the 18th year since the start of the war with Qingqiu, and since then everything has changed in Hokkaigan. Thousands of the Kaiganese settlers and loyalists of the defunct Fuso colony had fled northward in the years following the collapse of imperial control over the continent, due to reprisals and hostility from the now emboldened Buyeoans and Qingqiuans. Shinminato, the capital of the region, had already grown in size far beyond what local subsistence agriculture could support during the century of Japanese rule. This has bode poorly, as it was the primary destination for the lion's share of refugees. Now bursting at the seams, poverty has become a fixture of life in the colonial capital, leading to heightened hostility to properly native Kaiganese and the lower classes flooding the South side of the Fraser river in shanty towns, and the upper class outpurchasing local urbanites of their home, exsasperating relations between the Xiazhouren, local Kaiganese, and the newcomers. Many too have gone even further abroad, crowding the disperately scattered islets and fjords of Hokkaigan, as well as flooding the rough interior of the territory. This compromises the status of the indigenous Sokonomizu, who had for centuries been left mostly undisturbed in their isolated communities by East Asian colonialism, and are now set to be the primary target of the coming waves of migration from the Southern families. This situation only stands to worsen as the years drag on, as the birth rate in Hokkaigan shows no signs of stalling, and the generation following that of the migrants is just reaching adulthood. With little that the colonial administration can (or is willing) to do, it is only a matter of time before things escalate."
