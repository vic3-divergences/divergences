 dvg_granada.1.t: "The Colombian Independence War and the Viceroyalty of New Granada"
 dvg_granada.1.d: "Treachery!"
 dvg_granada.1.f: "The Independence of New Spain has sent ripples throughout Arcadia and Ameriga, and these ripples have finally reached Granada. This so-called Colombian Alliance wants independence from the Spanish Crown and New Toledo's loyalty recently has proven fickle, leaving New Granada as the sole remaining loyal Viceroyalty in the New World. We must drive back these upstarts and restore the Crown's control over New Spain, lest the revolutionary fervor spreads to our Viceroyalty as well."
 dvg_granada.1.a: "For New Granada! For Spain!"
 dvg_granada.2.t: "The Colombian Alliance is Defeated"
 dvg_granada.2.d: "The revolt in New Spain has been quelled, and the Crown's sovereignity over Mesoameriga is secured."
 dvg_granada.2.f: "Victory! In the ruined countryside and cities of New Spain, the might of the Spanish has never been seen more than now. The Alliance loyalists have been routed and Mexico City once again belongs to the Spanish Viceroy. It will take some time before cities and villages of New Spain are restored to their former glory, but now it's clear that Spain is there to stay, and we shall stand with them as we always did."
 dvg_granada.2.a: "We stand with Spain!"
 dvg_granada.3.t: "The Truce of 1840"
 dvg_granada.3.d: "Stalemate. The Colombian Alliance has seceded, but New Granada is secure."
 dvg_granada.3.f: "The Colombian Independence War is over, and the Spanish forces retreat back to New Granada. Despite our loyalty to the Crown, the Colombian revolt has inspired many people within New Granada, and these voices have only grown louder with the Colombian Alliance's success. New movements are taking form, with the republicans and royalists alike asking for self-governance and independence from Madrid. The time to act is now, lest we too are embroiled in a fratricidal war."
 dvg_granada.3.a: "We shall stand loyal to Spain in exchange for greater autonomy. At least for now."
 dvg_granada.4.t: "The Fall of Bogota"
 dvg_granada.4.d: "Guillermo de Blanco has finally made his move. Boosting the ranks of his veteran guerilla army with opportunistic elites, traitorous army personnel, and disgruntled peasantry, de Blanco has emerged from hiding and has launched a series of attacks on New Granadan cities!"
 dvg_granada.4.f: "First Bogota, then Cartagena have fallen before his insurrectionary army. Due to the sparse nature of the New Granadan garrisons with the routing of all available troops to the Colombian front, few outposts are well-staffed enough to oppose him. Worse, many communities are starting to voluntarily align with the increasingly popular revolutionary…"
 dvg_granada.4.a: "The ghost of de Herrera looms large over New Granada."
 dvg_granada.5.t: "The Herrera Revolution"
 dvg_granada.5.d: "Treason! General de Blanco has proclaimed the Republic of Herreria and seceded from Granada!"
 dvg_granada.5.f: "With the acquisition of Medellin, de Blanco is now prepared to fully contest Spanish rule of New Granada. In a speech delivered from Viceroy Rocafuerte's former mansion, de Blanco has declared himself the “Great Liberator” of a new revolutionary nation, the Republic of Herreria! The insurrectionary state is named after infamous New Granadan revolutionary José de Herrera, who fought both the Incans and the Spanish crown before being killed by Washkar Inca. It seems that de Blanco thinks himself a second de Herrera, and with much of western New Granada now aligned towards him, he might just be able to back up his claims. As northern Ameriga plunges back into the inferno, we must once again prepare for a bitter struggle in the New World."
 dvg_granada.5.a: "Revolution is a malaise of New World minds..."
 dvg_granada.5.b: "The freedom of the New World is the hope of the universe! (Play as Herreria)"
 dvg_granada.5.c: "Enjoy your so-called revolutionary state, madman."
 dvg_granada.5.e: "Long live Herreria! Long live de Blanco! (Play as Herreria)"
 dvg_granada.6.t: "The Dream is Dead"
 dvg_granada.6.d: "The warlords of Granada carve out their domains and the dream of united Granada is no more."
 dvg_granada.6.f: "With de Blanco's revolutionaries firmly in control of Herreria, Antonio Rocafuerte makes his move and proclaims the Kingdom of Aureliana in Caracas, followed by Guianan separatists in Essequibo. Where once New Granada stood, three new powers have emerged, each with different views on the fate of what was once the Viceroyalty. Despite their best efforts to drive out the Spanish, they could not save the dream of united Granada."
 dvg_granada.6.a: "The end of an era, or merely the start of one? (Play as Aureliana)"
 dvg_granada.6.b: "At least we may celebrate this victory. (Play as Essequibo)"
 dvg_granada.7.t: "The Raid on the Caracas Armory"
 dvg_granada.7.d: "De Blanco's revolutionaries strike at Caracas!"
 dvg_granada.7.f: "We thought that the end of the struggle with Colombia would inaugurate a new era of stability in the rest of our empire, but this seems to have been too optimistic. This morning, word reached the royal court that the Spanish Army’s Caracas armory was looted by the guerilla forces of notorious revolutionary Guillermo de Blanco! Apparently, Ramon Salgar, a llanero (cowboy) warlord who is de Blanco’s right-hand man and a native of Aureliana, used a little-known mountain path to bypass the local patrols, then assaulted the town shortly after midnight. His feared Legion of Hell overpowered the initial defenses and headed straight for the armory, blowing open the doors and grabbing all the arms and ammunition that they could carry. As they absconded back into the wilderness, they shouted horrid curses towards the Spanish crown, and cried, “Viva Salgar! Viva de Blanco!” De Blanco’s traitors are now quite well-armed."
 dvg_granada.7.a: "Bring me the head of Guillermo de Blanco!"
 dvg_granada.8.t: "Raids in Cartagena Countryside"
 dvg_granada.8.d: "De Blanco's revolutionaries strike at Cartagena!"
 dvg_granada.8.f: "De Blanco wasted no time in putting his ill-gotten gains to use. He has returned to a more confrontational posture, launching coordinated assaults upon loyalist communities throughout the greater Cartagena region. Guerillas have attacked villages across the area, pilfering everything from crops and livestock to tools and medicine. Any town which does not sufficiently “support” de Blanco’s cause is a potential target. As the guerillas wage their most ambitious campaign of violence yet, de Blanco is slowly but surely approaching Medellin, local administrative center of New Granada. If Medellin falls, the whole Spanish colonial government may be imperiled."
 dvg_granada.8.a: "Medellin must not fall!"
 dvg_granada.9.t: "Essequibo Declares Independence!"
 dvg_granada.9.d: "New Granada's eastern flank, Essequibo has proclaimed independence!"
 dvg_granada.9.f: "As New Granada plunges into civil war, the Guianan separatists in the east have taken the opportunity to proclaim their own state, the Republic of Essequibo."
 dvg_granada.9.a: "We can't spare the resources, let them have it."
 dvg_granada.10.t: "The Spanish Withdraw from New Granada"
 dvg_granada.10.d: "The Spanish forces in New Granada are abandoning the colony!"
 dvg_granada.10.f: "With de Blanco in control of western New Granada, the Spanish forces have ordered a retreat from the colony. In Medellin, none of two revolutionaries could agree on New Granada’s future. Former Viceroy Rocafuerte sought a monarchy and General de Blanco a centralized republic. Worst of all was that both men insisted that they should assume supreme leadership over whichever nation emerged from the council. The men have declared the meeting a failure and are presumed to be preparing to leave the city, with the future of New Granada still in doubt. One thing is certain... Spain has been cast out of New Granada, but the struggle is not over yet."
 dvg_granada.10.a: "We have won the war and now must win the peace."
 dvg_granada.11.t: "Rocafuerte Triumphant!"
 dvg_granada.11.d: "The monarchist forces have prevailed."
 dvg_granada.11.f: "It ended, fittingly, in a church. De Blanco and his men, their forces shattered from repeated defeats by Rocafuerte’s monarchists, took refuge in a small parish near Cartagena. They mounted a last stand which ended when a young captain named Simon Morillo ran into the storehouse being used as a powder room and torched the magazine. The resulting fireball killed himself, de Blanco, and most of the republicans. Though rumors persist of de Blanco’s survival, nearly all the republicans have surrendered."
 dvg_granada.11.a: "Hail, oh Fatherland, a thousand times! Oh Fatherland, Glory be to you!"
 dvg_granada.12.t: "De Blanco Triumphant!"
 dvg_granada.12.d: "The republican forces have prevailed."
 dvg_granada.12.f: "After a series of grueling confrontations, de Blanco’s republicans have finally defeated Rocafuerte’s monarchists. The final battle saw Rocafuerte lead his personal guard on a valiant but doomed cavalry charge straight towards de Blanco’s lines, where the would-be emperor perished in his saddle from a rifle shot to the chest."
 dvg_granada.12.a: "Hail, oh Fatherland, a thousand times! Oh Fatherland, Glory be to you!"
 dvg_granada.13.t: "Truce Between Rocafuerte and de Blanco?"
 dvg_granada.13.d: "The Granadan Civil War has been waged for too long."
 dvg_granada.13.f: "The revolutionaries de Blanco and Rocafuerte both harbor different visions on how Granada shall be ruled, but none are able to overpower the other. It might be time to finally realize that Granada isn't able to be united under any of them."
 dvg_granada.13.a: "We can't go on like that anymore, sign the truce."
 dvg_granada.13.b: "Granada WILL be whole again."
 dvg_granada.14.t: "The Truce is Signed"
 dvg_granada.14.d: "The Granadan revolutionaries agree to stand down."
 dvg_granada.14.f: "The Herrera Revolution has ended. With de Blanco and Rocafuerte agreeing to stop hostilities, the future of North Ameriga is uncertain."
 dvg_granada.14.a: "Everything has a beginning and an end."
 dvg_granada.15.t: "Proclamation of the Granadan Empire"
 dvg_granada.15.d: "The Monarchists have triumphed over the Republicans!"
 dvg_granada.15.f: "In a grand ceremony in Caracas, Rocafuerte was crowned Antonio I, Emperor of Granada! To encourage support for the new regime, his first act as sovereign was to adopt a limited constitution to lay the realm’s legal foundation and combat charges of absolutism. As the Emperor is an abolitionist, having had many former slaves amongst his llanero raiding parties, he has also ended slavery across Granada."
 dvg_granada.15.a: "Viva el Emperador!"
 dvg_granada.16.t: "Proclamation of the Kingdom of Aureliana"
 dvg_granada.16.d: "The Monarchist cause in Aureliana is successful."
 dvg_granada.16.f: "In a grand ceremony in Caracas, Rocafuerte was crowned Antonio I, King of Aureliana! To encourage support for the new regime, his first act as sovereign was to adopt a limited constitution to lay the realm’s legal foundation and combat charges of absolutism. As the King is an abolitionist, having had many former slaves amongst his llanero raiding parties, he has also ended slavery across Aureliana."
 dvg_granada.16.a: "Viva el Rey!"
 dvg_granada.17.t: "Proclamation of the Granadan Republic"
 dvg_granada.17.d: "The Republicans have triumphed over the Monarchists!"
 dvg_granada.17.f: "De Blanco returned to Medellin in triumph and was acclaimed by a cheering crowd as the first President of Granada! However, some are already concerned about the intended path of his rule. Though he has organized elections to compose a new legislature, he has upheld wartime censorship and is personally overseeing the redrawing of electoral constituencies. He has also become known for his... strong remarks about Indians and blacks and has remained mute on the issue of slavery. It is hoped that he shall grow into his new role as leader of Granada."
 dvg_granada.17.a: "Viva el Presidente!"
 dvg_granada.18.t: "Proclamation of the Herrerian Republic"
 dvg_granada.18.d: "Herreria emerges as an independent republic."
 dvg_granada.18.f: "De Blanco returned to Medellin in triumph and was acclaimed by a cheering crowd as the first President of Herreria! However, some are already concerned about the intended path of his rule. Though he has organized elections to compose a new legislature, he has upheld wartime censorship and is personally overseeing the redrawing of electoral constituencies. He has also become known for his... strong remarks about Indians and blacks and has remained mute on the issue of slavery. It is hoped that he shall grow into his new role as leader of Herreria."
 dvg_granada.18.a: "Viva el Presidente!"
 dvg_granada.19.t: "The Dissolution of New Granada"
 dvg_granada.19.d: "The Viceroyalty of New Granada, once a beacon of Spanish power, now divided between its own freedom fighters."
 dvg_granada.19.f: "New Granada, barely even alive, has already perished at the hands of its supposed liberators. The republicans of Herreria and the monarchists of Aureliana proved unable to overcome one another, and de Blanco and Rocafuerte were forced to partition the embryonic nation after a series of bitter peace negotiations. While each man is now free to shape his country as he sees fit, the dream of a united New Granada has set beyond the horizon like the fading sun. De Blanco and Rocafuerte may go down in history as the fathers of their respective nations, but they will always be foremost remembered as the men who destroyed New Granada for the sake of their own ambitions."
 dvg_granada.19.a: "The Granadan state, built on hope, has been strangled in its cradle."
 dvg_granada.20.t: "The Dream is Dead"
 dvg_granada.20.d: "The warlords of Granada carve out their domains and the dream of united Granada is no more."
 dvg_granada.20.f: "With de Blanco's revolutionaries firmly in control of Herreria, Antonio Rocafuerte makes his move and proclaims the Kingdom of Aureliana in Caracas, followed by Guianan separatists in Essequibo. Where once New Granada stood, three new powers have emerged, each with different views on the fate of what was once the Viceroyalty. Despite their best efforts to drive out the Spanish, they could not save the dream of united Granada."
 dvg_granada.20.a: "The Granadan dream lies shattered."
 dvg_granada.21.t: "The Council of New Granada in Bogota"
 dvg_granada.21.d: "The end of the war with Spain has left northern Ameriga in an uncertain position. Guillermo de Blanco controls Herreria, Antonio Rocafuerte rules Aureliana, and Martin Ballivian holds Quito, but New Granada is not yet whole. All three men and their associates have agreed to meet at the former Royal Library of Santa Fe in Bogota to reconcile and determine the future of New Granada."
 dvg_granada.21.f: "The meeting may be tense, as Rocafuerte – already disliked by de Blanco due to his dubious, possibly mulatto, ancestry, and outspoken opposition to slavery – has begun to speak out against de Blanco’s increasingly violent and erratic behavior, while Ballivian is seen as an outsider who may attempt to push both other men aside in pursuit of his own designs. Ballivian’s spies are rumored to already be operating around Bogota…"
 dvg_granada.21.a: "We have won the war and now must win the peace."
 dvg_granada.22.t: "The Council of New Granada in Bogota"
 dvg_granada.22.d: "Spain has been cast out of New Granada, but the struggle is not over yet. Guillermo de Blanco of Herreria has grown more violent and erratic since the end of the revolution, with his second-in-command Antonio Rocafuerte of Aureliana strongly questioning his leadership."
 dvg_granada.22.f: "In the interest of solidarity, both men have agreed to meet at the former Royal Library of Santa Fe in Bogota to determine New Granada’s future, and our leader Martin Ballivian has made it plain that he will attend as well. Neither man should be underestimated and it is unlikely that they will accept Ballivian’s leadership. Therefore we have sent several army units ahead in disguise to blend in with the locals, should the need arise for them…"
 dvg_granada.22.a: "We will be prepared for anything."
 dvg_granada.23.t: "The Council Dissolves"
 dvg_granada.23.d: "Bogota proved fruitless. None of the three revolutionaries could agree on New Granada’s future. Rocafuerte sought a monarchy, Ballivian a decentralized confederation, and de Blanco a centralized republic."
 dvg_granada.23.f: "There were also de Blanco’s repeated demands for extreme restrictions on all indigenous peoples, as well as calling for war with Tawantinsuyu so often that he was privately compared with Cato the Censor. Worst of all was that each man insisted that he assume supreme leadership over whichever nation emerged from the council. All three men have declared the meeting a failure and are presumed to be preparing to leave the city, with the future of New Granada still in doubt."
 dvg_granada.23.a: "What happened to solidarity?"
 dvg_granada.24.t: "Rocafuerte Attempts a Coup!"
 dvg_granada.24.d: "Rocafuerte did not accept the failure of the Council of New Granada – he wanted a unified state, nothing less. As soon as he departed, he met up with his personal guard, their numbers bolstered by monarchist sympathizers who had made their way to Bogota for this purpose."
 dvg_granada.24.f: "Soon they marched on the Royal Library of Santa Fe, intent on surrounding the building and forcing Ballivian and de Blanco to accept Rocafuerte as the new Emperor of New Granada. While Rocafuerte loyalists have also been dispatched to seal off Bogota and prevent the other two men from escaping, rumors swirl that they may have already made it out of the city…"
 dvg_granada.24.a: "New Granada’s future hangs by a thread."
 dvg_granada.25.t: "The Bogota Crisis"
 dvg_granada.25.d: "Rocafuerte had barely established his royalist junta before it became known that both Ballivian and de Blanco had escaped. The Quitenese caudillo soon returned with his own forces! He had expected resistance and had sent soldiers ahead of him, who dispersed in disguise throughout the surrounding villages, hiding his true strength."
 dvg_granada.25.f: "At his signal they rallied to southern Bogota – but Ballivian had to make a choice. Rocafuerte had a larger army than he had anticipated, and more were coming. Fleeing back to Quito would be the safer option, but without glory. Fighting Rocafuerte in the streets could earn him hegemony in Hispanic Ameriga but could also be the death of him. In the end, he chose to…"
 dvg_granada.25.a: "Leave the fighting to his general, Ferdinand Torres."
 dvg_granada.25.b: "Meet the traitor Rocafuerte head on!"
 dvg_granada.26.t: "The Battle of Bogota"
 dvg_granada.26.d: "The Ballivianistas and the Rocafuertistas engaged in pitched fighting throughout the city and its surrounding environs. Through Ballivian’s cunning use of the local geography, Rocafuerte’s forces were lured into a series of ambushes and whittled down to a fraction of their former strength. In the confusion, de Blanco also attempted to rally his own forces against both men but was similarly overcome."
 dvg_granada.26.f: "Ballivian’s men captured both traitors and, after a swift trial for conspiring against “the New Granadan people,” they were publicly hanged. With Ballivian now preparing for the war with the Inca, he has delegated rule of the northern provinces to several trusted (and rather unambitious) lieutenants until the southern threat is dealt with."
 dvg_granada.26.a: "¡Viva Ballivian!"
 dvg_granada.27.t: "The Flight of Ballivian"
 dvg_granada.27.d: "Ballivian managed to escape Rocafuerte’s trap. Activating several Quitenese cells who had infiltrated the region in the weeks prior to the Council, his forces fought a rearguard action until he had made his escape. However, the Quiteneses proved unwilling to challenge the Aurelianan coup, and now Rocafuerte has one last obstacle : de Blanco, his former leader."
 dvg_granada.27.f: "De Blanco is believed to be heading to Cartagena to rally his main army and confront Rocafuerte, but their loyalty is wavering with rumors spreading of de Blanco’s mental instability. If Rocafuerte captures him before he arrives then this drama could come to an abrupt close, but if not, New Granada will know war once again…"
 dvg_granada.27.a: "Bring me the head of Guillermo de Blanco!"
 dvg_granada.28.t: "The New Granadan Civil War"
 dvg_granada.28.d: "“Flee the country where a lone man holds all power: It is a nation of slaves.” - José de Herrera"
 dvg_granada.28.f: "De Blanco proved too wily to be captured. Upon his arrival in Cartagena, he denounced Rocafuerte as a traitor and an aspiring despot, likening him to the hated King Jose II of Spain and even the “preening autocrat of the Incans!” Across Herreria, republican support has surged, and Rocafuerte and his men fled back to Aurelia to avoid being swept up in the chaos. What began as a squabble between revolutionary allies-turned-rivals has escalated into a clash of ideas, a confrontation between republicanism and monarchism which will determine the fate of Hispanic Ameriga and the tenor of its soul."
 dvg_granada.28.a: "May God grant victory to our perseverance!"
 dvg_granada.28.b: "May God grant victory to our perseverance! (Play as Herreria)"
 dvg_granada.29.t: "The Opportunity of a Lifetime"
 dvg_granada.29.d: "The end of Ballivian’s quest to liberate Quito has been a disaster for Hispanic Ameriga. Rather than rest in the hands of a visionary bringer of civilization, Quito has fallen into the grasp of all manner of petty despots and rogues. Now, the savage Incans seek to cut a swath of destruction across the continent, and Quito lies in the path of their blade."
 dvg_granada.29.f: "This is too hideous a fate for New Granada to tolerate! President de Blanco knows this, and so he has made the momentous decision to intervene in the war, seeking to both protect Quito and destroy the Incan threat forever. While the manner of his…”protection” of Quito may perturb some, the only way that Hispanic Ameriga will ever be safe is if it is unified, as de Herrera always knew."
 dvg_granada.29.a: "Onwards, for the sake of our people!"
 dvg_granada.30.t: "The Council of Granada in Bogota"
 dvg_granada.30.d: "The end of the war with Spain has left northern Ameriga in an uncertain position. Guillermo de Blanco controls Herreria and Antonio Rocafuerte rules Aureliana, but New Granada is not yet whole."
 dvg_granada.30.f: "Both men and their associates have agreed to meet at the former Royal Library of Santa Fe in Bogota to determine the future of New Granada. The meeting may be tense, as Rocafuerte – already disliked by de Blanco due to his dubious, possibly mulatto, ancestry, and outspoken opposition to slavery – has begun to speak out against de Blanco’s increasingly violent and erratic behavior. He has even proposed that New Granada may require a monarchy to stabilize it, much to de Blanco’s disdain…"
 dvg_granada.30.a: "We have won the war and now must win the peace."
 dvg_granada.31.t: "The Council Dissolves"
 dvg_granada.31.d: "Bogota proved fruitless. Neither of the former revolutionary allies or their supporters could agree on New Granada’s future. Rocafuerte sought a monarchy, but de Blanco declared that anything less than a republic would be too tainted by the influences of Spain and even Tawantinsuyu."
 dvg_granada.31.f: "There were also de Blanco’s repeated demands for extreme restrictions on all indigenous peoples, as well as calling for war with the Incans so often that he was privately compared with Cato the Censor. Worst of all was that each man insisted that he assume supreme leadership over whichever nation emerged from the council. Both of them have declared the meeting a failure and are presumed to be preparing to leave the city, with the future of New Granada still in doubt"
 dvg_granada.31.a: "What happened to solidarity?"

 dvg_granada.32.a: "New Granada’s future hangs by a thread."
 dvg_granada.33.t: "The Battle of Bogota"
 dvg_granada.33.d: "De Blanco had already fled the Library by the time Rocafuerte arrived, and rallied his own forces to confront his former lieutenant."
 dvg_granada.33.f: "Brutal street-by-street fighting ensued as the whole city and the surrounding area became the site of a pitched struggle between Blancistas and Rocafuertistas. So far neither side has been able to gain a decisive advantage. If this battle results in a stalemate, then either Rocafuerte or de Blanco may be forced to flee Bogota and gather their main armies elsewhere. Such a development could only result in civil war…"
 dvg_granada.33.a: "We must prevail!"
 dvg_granada.33.b: "We must prevail! (Play as Herreria)"
 dvg_granada.34.t: "Apocalypse"
 dvg_granada.34.d: "”The Incan savage is not a true human being : it possesses no soul, no capacity for the great powers of either logical thought or creative imagination which so bless those of the higher races. The masses of the interior are lowly and inferior peoples, who have always known only subjugation. The best of them are fit for servitude alone : the worst are life undeserving of life, mere shells to be discarded.” – Guillermo de Blanco"
 dvg_granada.34.f: "The Empire of the Four Corners lies in ruins. New Granada has taken all that was once strong, vibrant, and beautiful in the southern Andes, and obliterated it. The imperial armies were bested in the very lands of our ancestors, and the foreign savages surged south. Imperial rule collapsed under the weight of the fiasco, the Sapa Inca vanishing during riots which convulsed the capital. Where once stood the empire of Pachacuti now lies only a rotten corpse, already half-processed by the colonial machinery of New Granada."
 dvg_granada.34.a: "Carthago diruta est."
 dvg_granada.35.t: "The Ruins of an Empire"
 dvg_granada.35.d: "Tawantinsuyu lies in shambles before us. Our forces thrashed our way to the imperial capital, and the savage Incan high chief disappeared during the final battle, presumed dead. His loss, and the ensuing pillaging of both the capital proper and the areas under occupation, have devastated the Incan Empire beyond all hope of recovery. We have thus taken this opportunity to reorganize the Inca state to suit our interests."
 dvg_granada.35.f: "All local Inca chiefs will be purged, and all lands seized by the state to be sold off to new settlers. Pagan temples will be destroyed, and churches erected upon the ruins. Of particular interest is the mita system of labor, which should smooth over the transition to a more…modern form of service for the inferior races. The old city of Cusco will be demolished to make way for a new, modern one. There may still be a Tawantinsuyu but it is now our property."
 dvg_granada.35.a: "And civilization – brutal as it is – has finally come to the Andes."
 dvg_granada.36.t: "A Stab in the Back"
 dvg_granada.36.d: "Guillermo de Blanco, President of New Granada, has long harbored ambitions of unifying Hispanic Ameriga and enacting his vengeance upon the Inca."
 dvg_granada.36.f: "However, our own war has caused him to place the former ahead of the latter and declare war upon us! While he and his government insist that their forces are “protecting” Quito from the Inca hordes, this is clearly not a mere support expedition, but a full-fledged invasion of both ourselves and the Inca at once."
 dvg_granada.36.a: "Whose side is he on?!"
 dvg_granada.37.t: "Quito’s Darkest Hour"
 dvg_granada.37.d: "Martin Ballivian, the savior of Quito, is facing the greatest peril of his life: an all-out war with the savage Inca Empire. They seek to cut a swath of destruction across the continent, and Quito lies in the path of their blade."
 dvg_granada.37.f: "This is too hideous a fate for New Granada to tolerate! President de Blanco knows this, and so he has made the momentous decision to intervene in the war, seeking to both protect Quito and destroy the Incan threat forever. The two great liberators of the Andes shall stand side by side once again, for the sake of all civilized peoples in Ameriga!"
 dvg_granada.37.a: "Quito calls for aid, and New Granada shall answer!"
 dvg_granada.38.t: "New Granada Stands with Us!"
 dvg_granada.38.d: "Guilermo de Blanco, the heroic president of New Granada, has long been the steadfast ally and friend of our leader, President Ballivian, as well as sharing his ambitions of revenge against the Inca. Now, with the Incan puma at our gates, he has rallied his forces and declared his intervention on our side!"
 dvg_granada.38.f: "Just this morning, de Blanco himself arrived in Quito in full military dress along with his advance guard, with the rest of the New Granadan army to follow. The two great liberators of the Andes, Ballivian and de Blanco, shall stand side by side once again, for the sake of all civilized peoples in Ameriga!"
 dvg_granada.38.a: "We shall make de Herrera proud!"
 dvg_granada.39.t: "New Granadan Intervention!"
 dvg_granada.39.d: "The murderous barbarian of New Granada, Guillermo de Blanco, has long been crazed with hatred of all native Amerigan peoples, but has harbored a particular obsession with destroying Tawantinsuyu as vengeance for his humiliation during de Herrera’s expedition."
 dvg_granada.39.f: "Now de Blanco has declared that New Granada shall join Quito in their war against us! Once more, de Herrera’s savage disciples dare to defy us."
 dvg_granada.39.a: "May Inti sear them to ashes!"
 dvg_granada.40.t: "Apocalypse"
 dvg_granada.40.d: "”The Incan savage is not a true human being : it possesses no soul, no capacity for the great powers of either logical thought or creative imagination which so bless those of the higher races. The masses of the interior are lowly and inferior peoples, who have always known only subjugation. The best of them are fit for servitude alone : the worst are life undeserving of life, mere shells to be discarded.” – Guillermo de Blanco"
 dvg_granada.40.f: "The Empire of the Four Corners lies in ruins. New Granada has taken all that was once strong, vibrant, and beautiful in the southern Andes, and obliterated it. The imperial armies were bested in the very lands of our ancestors, and the foreign savages surged south. Imperial rule collapsed under the weight of the fiasco, the Sapa Inca vanishing during riots which convulsed the capital. Where once stood the empire of Pachacuti now lies only a rotten corpse, already half-processed by the colonial machinery of New Granada."
 dvg_granada.40.a: "Carthago diruta est."
 dvg_granada.41.t: "The Ruins of an Empire"
 dvg_granada.41.d: "Tawantinsuyu lies in shambles before us. Our forces thrashed our way to the imperial capital, and the savage Incan high chief disappeared during the final battle, presumed dead. His loss, and the ensuing pillaging of both the capital proper and the areas under occupation, have devastated the Incan Empire beyond all hope of recovery."
 dvg_granada.41.f: "We have thus taken this opportunity to reorganize the Inca state to suit our interests. All local Inca chiefs will be purged, and all lands seized by the state to be sold off to new settlers. Pagan temples will be destroyed, and churches erected upon the ruins. Of particular interest is the mita system of labor, which should smooth over the transition to a more…modern form of service for the inferior races. The old city of Cusco will be demolished to make way for a new, modern one. There may still be a Tawantinsuyu but it is now our property" 
 dvg_granada.41.a: "And civilization – brutal as it is – has finally come to the Andes."

 dvg_rocafuerte_afro_latino_citizens: "Integrate the Afro-Latinos"
 dvg_rocafuerte_afro_latino_citizens_desc: "Rocafuerte has been a fierce enemy of slavery and ally of Black New Granadans since he began his rebellion. It is commonly believed - though he has refused to ever address the subject - that he himself is a mulatto, with at least one of his ancestors having African blood. His guerilla army emphasized recruiting escaped or freed slaves. Therefore it is only natural that we pass new laws to integrate the Black population of New Granada. This will involve imposing hiring quotas for government agencies, banning racial discrimination by businesses, and directing investments to Black communities. It will take many years to fully accomplish but in time we shall erase the color line dividing Blacks from our society."
 dvg_de_blanco_revenge: "The Day of Reckoning"
 dvg_de_blanco_revenge_desc: "Guillermo de Blanco remembers well the black day when his greatest hero, Jose “El Liberador” de Herrera, was struck down on the battlefield by the forces of Washkar Inca. He still bears the scars of that battle, still feels the humiliation of defeat. Every day since then, he has kept one thought constantly in his mind : revenge. Revenge against Washkar. Against the Inca Empire. Against the entire Indian race of Ameriga. It is a thought which has devoured every other aspect of his personality, but now, finally, he has a chance to enact his vengeance. Quito is fighting for its life against the Inca. The situation provides an excellent pretext for New Granada to intervene, and for de Blanco to settle the blood debt which was incurred when El Liberador was cast from his saddle all those years ago. The only question is, will he come as Quito’s savior? Or its master?"
 dvg_ballivian_return: "Negotiate Unification with Quito"
 dvg_ballivian_return_desc: "With the Inca threat eliminated, Ballivian’s power in Quito is now unrivalled, yet he is also in our debt. While de Blanco would never seek to extort his dear friend, the fact remains that we would be far stronger together than separate. Thankfully, Ballivian has proven open to negotiation. He is willing to organize a “mostly fair” referendum on the question of annexation into New Granada, and the result would likely be favorable. In return, he would be allowed to govern Quito proper for as long as he pleases, and Quitenese cultural rights would be enshrined in law. Though some are disturbed by the amount of power that Ballivian desires, it seems a small price to pay for the bloodless unification of Hispanic Ameriga."
