 je_conquest_of_africa: "The African Holdings"
 je_conquest_of_africa_reason: "The Aragonese-Algierian War (1500-1512) was the first major conflict Aragon launched against an African power, and the first major conflict since the end of the Reconquista in 1492 (the Spanish conquest of Melilla in 1497 notwithstanding) in response to the frequent barbary raids in its area of the Mediterranean. The twelve year long conflict saw the entirety of the Algerian Coast gained for Aragon, the single largest takeover of Muslim land since Ferdinand III’s conquest of much of Spain. Now, all that is left is the curtail the remainder of the Barbary threat."

 dvg_aragon.1.t: "The Crown of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_aragon.1.d: "The beginning of the XIXth century has been hard for the old crown of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 dvg_aragon.1.f: "The beginning of the XIXth century has been hard for the old crown of Aragon. After the incompetence and corruption of the reign of Ferran VI Borja which saw the Aragonese nearly lose their Italian possessions because of the Etrurian revolution and the Santamarian insurrections in Naples his brother and heir Ferran VI died after only 44 days of rule. His daughter Maria was cast aside by the legitimized bastard of Joan IV Josep of Serna who now rules the Crown and its various territories. Numerous challenges await the monarch : North Africa is far from being pacified with a rebellion of Berber tribes spilling over the Aragonese settlements. Italy remains a divided mess : our Sicilian holdings are plagued by banditry and plotters while the Etrurian republic still lives although the most revolutionary factions are inactive for now. Both Burgundy and the Dual-Monarchy influence the Northern princes and among them Milan may especially prove troublesome."
 dvg_aragon.1.a: "Sempre endavant mai morirem."

 dvg_aragon.2.t: "The Escape of Maria Borja"
 dvg_aragon.2.d: "Following her deposition by the Cortes General and the annulation of her betrothal to the duke of Milan Maria Borja has lived under house arrest on the island of Capri in the bay of Naples.Then, just the other night she boarded a Genoan ship bought by the duke of Milan and she arrived in Genoa before any Aragonese ships could arrest her and from there joined Massimiliano Maria heir of Leopoldo I in Milan where they were wed in great pomp."
 dvg_aragon.2.f: "While posing a threat to Josep Serna because of her legitimacy she was always seen as easily manipulated and not worth much surveillance. In these conditions the news of her escape as a great surprise to the Aragonese government. So far Maria has announced that she will not renegate her abdication and that she had formally renounced her claim to the Kingdom of Aragon but many legitimists gather throughout the Crown calling for the return of the 'Queen in Milan'."

 dvg_aragon.2.a: "Who would have thought that a former Queen would flee her little island ?"

 dvg_aragon.3.t: "Maria Borgia, Future Duchess of Milan"
 dvg_aragon.3.d: "Maria of Aragon had been promised to the son of Leopoldo I the prince of Legnano in the hopes of uniting peacefully Italy. However the usurpation of Josep Serna ended these hopes with the former queen sent under house arrest in the island of Capri"
 dvg_aragon.3.f: " Despite the betrothal officially broken by the Cortes-General Massimiliano never abandoned his fiancée and planned for her escape. Abord a Genoese ship bought by the Duke Maria fled and finally arrived in Milan where the two were married by the archbishop. While formally accepting her abdication of the crown of Aragon as to not provoke more Serna and upset the status quo the ducal couple has in private swore to retake their Italians possessions from the Catalans who wronged them. Already several legitimist nobles from Naples and Sicily so-called 'Borjists' have come to Milan to meet with their pretender."
 dvg_aragon.3.a: "Maria will become queen again!"

 dvg_aragon.4.t: ";The “Third Rome” Speech"
 dvg_aragon.4.d: ";The beginning of the XIXth century has been hard for the old crown of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 dvg_aragon.4.f: "”Your Majesty that all the Christian kingdoms came to an end coalesced into your realm two Romes have fallen the third stands and there will be no fourth. No one shall replace your Christian Kingdom as according to Revelation 17:10”\n\nAn speech has just been delivered in the Iberian Cortes by a noble claiming to have apparitions of John the Apostle - stating that Aragon is the sole and legal heir to Rome owing to its likeness to the Roman Empire of old. He proceeded that as Rome’s heirs Aragon must expand and unite all Latins under one realm. To say this speech is divisive would be an understatement. While the idea of this newfangled “Panlatin” movement piqued many commoners intellectuals and the Royal Court the rich and the powerful nobility scoff at the idea especially the part where they would submit under one crown. This is becoming an issue we cannot ignore any longer. How shall our King respond to this idea?"
 dvg_aragon.4.a: " "Panlatinism shall be a role model we shall aspire to...”"
 dvg_aragon.4.b: " We like this idea but we shall not committ yet..."
 dvg_aragon.4.c: " We are Aragonese, not Roman!”"

But as we restored Christendom to the shores of Africa and Aethiopia the infidel Mohammedans in their eternal jealousy repeatedly razed our cities and villages our plantations and mines soaking the ground with the blood of settlers giving them their name “Peu-Vermell”. Even nowadays these raids organized by Tuggurt continue though today in their savagery they assaulted and almost killed the Count of Tabraca Ferran who previously set alight Mohammedan Ouargla in 1835. We have been pushed by the Peu-Vermell for some time to pacify the hinterland but now their cause rings true in the cortes of the Crown. That interest in land-clearing and more acquisitions of the well-established plantation owners of Africa can assuredly be seen as a minor benefit beside the revenge of Ferran of Tabraca..."

 dvg_ari_acceptitalians: "Proclaim the Empire of the Latins"
 dvg_ari_acceptitalians_desc: "For Centuries now the Crown of Aragon has been a dominant power on the Italian peninsula. But since the Revolutionary Wars the prospect of unifying the North into another Crown ruled by the Kings of Valencia has faded notably because the Italian nationalists have proclaimed us foreigners and imperialists..\n\nJosep Serna will not repeat the mistakes of his forefathers and rule Italy in personal union with Aragon like Sardinia, Sicily, Naples, and the other Crowns. The defunct Imperial Crown of the 12th-century Latin Empire will be the means to forge a new realm of Latins uniting Italy and Aragon under a single Emperor!"
 
 dvg_invade_tuggurt: "Pacify Tuggurt"

While we managed to pacify the raiding campaigns the sultanate spawned the interest of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ comes first: We must end the Mohammedan threat now before they can rebuild their forces and to appease the Peu-Vermell which stand to gain large tracts of lands at an affordable price"

 dvg_invade_sus: "End the Sus Amirate"
 dvg_invade_sus_reason: "The Sus Amirate emerged as an impostor kingdom to the Fez Sultanate of the Majjatids and remained a largely depopulated thorn on our side. Venting their frustrationsour colonial administration in Morocco claims regular critical sabotage by the Soussi forces and an emergency meeting in $CAPITAL$ pushed forward a radical solution to end this menace. A strike into the heart of these Soussi impostors should save the mates of our beloved country."
 
 dvg_ari_sicily_homelands: "Repeal the 1698 Treaty of Marsala"
 dvg_ari_sicily_homelands_desc: "The Treaty of Marsala was signed between the Aragonese Crown and the 'King in Trinacria', being a Sicilian noble who ruled over most of the island. The treaty agreed to prevent assimilation and Aragonese settlement of the island in 1671, after a significant wave of migration and destabilisation on the island. The 'King in Trinacria' title would be abolished in 1743, yet the treaty remained. \n\nHowever with the explosive growth of the Aragonese heartlands, we cannot contain our own population any longer and must allow legal settlement on Sicily once more."

 callabero_decree: "Establish the Callabero Decreee."
 callabero_decree_desc: "Our rule in Spanish Mauretania continues to suffer due to the lack of native collaborators, forcing us to rely solely upon Spanish colonists and the colonial garrisons. A new measure has been suggested by the Minister of Justice, a Jew named Francisco Callabero, to enshrine the citizenship of all native Jews in our North African possessions. Jews were briefly made citizens of Spain during the Josephine era before the War of the Spanish Succession, after all, and the Jewish population on the mainland remains small. Hopefully this shall both strengthen our grip on Mauretania and accelerate the assimilation of the Mauretanian Jews."
