 je_seven_sisters: "Seven Sisters"
 je_seven_sisters_reason: "As it currently stands, the Belgian republics are divided on how they would be governed if they were to be united country.\n\n@information!#blue Gameplay Advice:\nTo fulfill this Journal Entry, you will need to form the Belgian Confederacy via the Journal tab under the Nation Formation section."
 belgian_formed_tt: "The Belgian Confederacy has formed."

 je_sanacomie: "Sanacomie Question"
 je_sanacomie_reason: "During the Belgian Revolution, the Plantagenians were able to keep control most of southern Arcadia, with their northern border being the Sanacomie region. However, the town of Vierset was successfully held onto by the Belgians and it remains in this position to this day."


 je_belgian_confederacy: "The Belgian Confederacy"
 je_belgian_confederacy_reason: "Although Belgium has formally united as a single country - it is still vulnerable to division on a state level. Should the country lose wars, declared bankruptcy, or be unable to reconcile its competing interest groups, it may very well go back to its divided state."
 je_belgian_confederacy_goal: "If Belgium stays united, by avoiding significant turmoil, financial trouble, and military losses, then it shall become an unbreakable nation."
 blc_fail_tt: "The Belgian Confederacy has collapsed."


 je_cbv_monarchy: "The Kingdom of Valoisie"
 je_cbv_monarchy_reason: "As mob rule and republican order have come crashing down, it is time to rally behind the tried and true form of government."
 cbv_tt: "We have vanquished Nouvelle Flanders."

 je_wylde_rytt: "The Wild Ride"
 je_wylde_rytt_reason: " "The ・Wylde Rytt・ is a phrase which emerged around $YEAR$ to describe the political conditions in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Factors such as the emergence of new political parties, the slavery debate, increased urbanization, widening economic disparity and growing immigration, all led to heightened public tension. The ten-year period of the Wylde Rytt saw multiple parties follow the  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('intelligentsia_scope').GetName] example and adopt tactics of mass organization while political machines sought to capture and manipulate the immigrant vote causing their opponents to double down on anti-immigrant rhetoric. The decade also saw [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] corporations influential since the Hanse der Neuen Welt (HNW) moved from L・beck to Arcadia and led to the creation of the New Burgundy Colony in the 17th century rapidly gaining power. Above all was a growing feeling that the current [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] constitution was insufficient and required amendment or even replacement. The result was a cavalcade of political struggle which often erupted into violence..." "

 je_wylde_rytt_goal: " [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('industrialists_scope').GetName] has gained enough clout to consolidate power."

 je_restore_blc: "Reuniting Belgium"
 je_restore_blc_reason: "Reuniting Belgium"
 restore_blc_tt: "None of the Belgian Republics exist as separate entities."

 je_nieuweu_cursus: "The New Course"
 je_nieuweu_cursus_reason: "The years following the Declaration of Nouvelle Bruges by the Groot-Regisseur [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] himself the political climate in Septimania has started to gradually feel the gradual heatwave of  [concept_dvg_blanquism] coming from Europe. This has started to upset the foundations of the Directorate and made wary a lot of statesmen due to the potential and future ramifications it may bring to our rule. However pro-Salanist students hailing from the University of Nouvelle Bruges focusing on the humanities and economics have put forth the idea of formulating a ・New Course・ as a reaction to this threat. Applying the ideas of Paternalism this ・new course・ aims to further develop the interests of Salanism to the age of industrialization: the promotion of ・corporatism・ to promote the interests of  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('industrialists_scope').GetName] with the state・s guidance the simultaneous development of industrial and military capacity - the encouragement of token social reforms to workers and citizens alike a new and rigorous ・police state・ and an ・aggressive・ and ・military first・ approach to Arcadianism (Havikisme). With the next Grand Council Convention taking place in a couple of days it is no denying that they shall prioritize this mere piece of paper from overachieving students into a major guiding force in their national policy for the coming years if not decades."

  je_manifest_destiny_blc: "From the Sea to the Lakes"
  je_manifest_destiny_blc_reason: "Our nation's history is that of settlers, who have come from Europe to settle the vast stretches of land that sits on Arcadia, occupied by savages and foreigners. As we have been blessed with this great opportunity, it is only righetous we take advantage of it by stretching our borders from the Atlantic to the Great Lakes."

  je_sponsor_settlers: "Sponsor Settlers"
  je_sponsor_settlers_desc: "By promoting our people settling outside of our borders, we can help manufacture an incident that allows us to claim the land they are on."
  je_claim_state: "Claim State"
  je_claim_state_desc: "Now that an adequate amount of our citizens live there, we can claim it as ours."



  dvg_manifest_destiny_septiman: "Destiny of the East"
  dvg_manifest_destiny_septiman_desc: "As our country is getting more populated and wealthy, there are growing calls to take the less inhabited lands right outside of our borders."

  je_arcadia_blc: "Realizing The Arcadian Dream"
  je_arcadia_blc_reason: "The history of European settlement in Arcadia has been one long litany of petty disputes and infighting. Ever since the first colonists set foot in the New World we were struggling with one another. The divisions of the continent will never be resolved unless they are erased. Our enlightened ideals and vibrant people are the perfect foundation for a new power which shall bear the torch of civilization throughout the continent and the world. Now that we have reached a point of total hegemony we can at last make the great Arcadian Dream a reality. From this day forward, all old allegiances are cast aside, we are all now and forever Arcadians! Firm and united, let us be rallying round our liberty as a band of brothers joined, strength and union we shall find!"

 #Belgium primer
 dvg_belgium.1.t: "The Seven Republics of New Burgundy"
 dvg_belgium.1.d: "Ever since our independence the “Seven Sisters” have struggled both amongst one another and against our neighbors. The Seven Republics remain aloof from one another, currently only bound by the Articles of Confederation. This document sheltered us through the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective] storm but it has not made us a true nation. "
 dvg_belgium.1.f: "We began as a Burgundian colony conquered by the Dual Monarchy in the 18th century. [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName] sought to absorb us into their abominable Arcadian Empire but the glorious Belgian Revolution broke their chains and secured our freedom. For this reason a constitutional convention has been called in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] where for weeks delegates have been crafting the foundation of a new united nation. Its prospective name is the “Belgian Confederacy” named for the ancient lands of Belgica whose fierce natives warred against the Romans and from which many of our settlers’ ancestors hail from..."
 dvg_belgium.1.a: "Nous le Peuple afin de former une union plus parfaite."

 dvg_belgium.2.t: "The Nouvèl Flande Constitutional Convention"
 dvg_belgium.2.d: "The conference to establish the founding document of the Belgian Confederacy is proceeding at pace. While it is far from finished unification of the Seven Republics currently seems inevitable."
 dvg_belgium.2.f: "As [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_CNF').GetAdjective] ’s capital city of Nouvelle Bruges has been selected as our new national capital they seem poised to take the lead of our new union."
 dvg_belgium.2.a: "Reject their demand"
 dvg_belgium.2.b: "Surrender control"

 dvg_belgium.3.t: "The Situation in Sanacomie"
 dvg_belgium.3.d: "During our revolution against the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective]  menace the brave Louisianais of eastern [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName] joined forces with the Seven Republics. However the royalist army was able to reconquer nearly all of Louisiane – only Vierset a town in the Sanacomie region was able to be saved."
 dvg_belgium.3.f: "The upcoming Arcadian Conference arranged by the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName] (also known as the "Brabantians") in Vierset will attempt to determine a more permanent border between our nations and whether Vierset belongs to our Confederation. While we do not wish to see blood shed over the issue few of our politicians believe that the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective]  will negotiate in good faith and there is a widespread expectation that the conference will fail..."
 dvg_belgium.3.a: "We shall try our best regardless."

 dvg_belgium.4.t: "The Arcadian Conference"
 dvg_belgium.4.d: "As expected the conference was a total debacle. The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective]  repeatedly accused us of attempting to legitimize our “illegal occupation” of Vierset and refused to even consider abandoning their claim to the province."
 dvg_belgium.4.f: "Moreover, our own delegation was a disorganized jumble of seven politicians – one from each republic – struggling to express a coherent message. They were further divided between the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName], the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('lions_ig').GetName]  (isolationists) and the Burgundian League (expansionists). The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName] drew criticism as angling to use the Sanacomie issue to claim more power and sell more weapons to the Seven Republics. Barely heard above the din were the Louisianais who were themselves outraged that the Seven Republics had “abandoned” them and were now contemplating returning Vierset to [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName]. The conference ended in bitter recrimination and many are blaming the high-handed [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName] for sabotaging the situation and not being more democratic..."
 dvg_belgium.4.a: "We need to stand together against the Plantagenian threat!"
 dvg_belgium.4.b: "Maybe we should send only one delegation next time..."

 dvg_belgium.5.t: "The Tenth Session of the Constitutional Convention"
 dvg_belgium.5.d: "The constitutional convention has been a hopeless back and forth since the end of the war against [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName]'s' hideous “Arcadian Empire.” It has been paralyzed between the “Three Leagues.” "
 dvg_belgium.5.f: "The  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('lions_ig').GetName] also known as the “Lions” want a unitary Belgium with a weak president and are isolationists. The Burgundian League or the “Crosses” want a federal Belgium with a strong president who can lead them to victory against the Plantagentians. There is also the fringe Brabantian League also known as the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName] or the “[SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('pb_scope').GetName]” which are a minor faction that espouse pan-Arcadianism. They are small but have rich friends whose appetite for wealth and power has been described as “rivaling Crassus.” They tend to align with the Burgundians but also favor a unitary state. The latest debate is about the central role of the government. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName] believe that only a strong Stadtholder can defend Belgium but they have been accused of angling for a dictatorship. Many others want more democratic safeguards."
 dvg_belgium.5.a: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName] are right - we need strength!"
 dvg_belgium.5.b: "The Burgundians persuade the room to uphold liberty"
 dvg_belgium.5.c: "The Calvinists of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('lions_ig').GetName]  rally around pacifism."


 dvg_belgium.6.t: "Anti-Cadien Sentiment"
 dvg_belgium.6.d: "More news has stoked the flames of rage against [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName]. Cities across the Seven Republics have seen demonstrations calling for war against the south demanding that we liberate the Louisianais from their debased servitude to Nouvelle-France."
 dvg_belgium.6.f: "The largest demonstration of all has been staged in Nouvelle Bruges right outside of the convention! Crowds waved unofficial versions of the proposed Belgian flag along with the banners of the Seven Republics and the old battle standard of the revolutionary Louisianais Republic. Their passionate and irate calls for retribution against the Cadiens have animated many delegates to overcome their hesitation and produce a constitution as soon as possible."
 dvg_belgium.6.a: "War is good for some things it seems..."
 dvg_belgium.6.b: "This sentiment needs to be discredited."


 dvg_belgium.7.t: "The Unification of the Belgian Confederacy"
 dvg_belgium.7.d: "Alas, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] republics have united into a single nation."
 dvg_belgium.7.f: "We the People of the Seven Republics in Order to form a more perfect Union establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity do ordain and establish this Constitution for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].” – Preamble to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] Constitution\n\nWhen New Burgundy won its freedom from the Cadien-ruled Arcadian Empire some thought it would shatter and that its republics would go their separate ways. Yet the Seven Sisters have remained under one roof and confirmed the solidarity of their family. The Belgian Constitution has finally been finished and signed and has gone out to the Seven Republics for ratification. While many rejoice at the unification of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] our admittance of Vierset as the “Vierset Territory” has provoked outrage in [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName]. The newly unified Belgian armed forces may soon undergo a trial by fire."
 dvg_belgium.7.a: "In the name of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], we defy the world!"

 dvg_belgium.8.t: "The Belgian Destiny"
 dvg_belgium.8.d: "Alas, the Belgian republics are on their way to unite into a single nation."
 dvg_belgium.8.f: "The day of unification has finally come : the Belgian constitution has been finalized and signed by our delegation to Nouvelle Bruges. All that remains now is its ratification. As the representatives of our state legislature read it over hear its preamble echoing through the chamber as read out by the Spreker an aura of confidence and hope fills the room. It is far from a perfect document – everyone agrees on that – but it is something new something bold something proud. It is a sacred promise of liberty and union. The vote itself is a mere formality."
 dvg_belgium.8.a: "Oui"
 dvg_belgium.8.b: "Non!"


 dvg_belgium.9.t: "Belgium has United!"
 dvg_belgium.9.d: "The Planteurs have often disparaged the Seven Republics confident that their attempts to build a unified democratic state were a doomed endeavor. The ratification of the  [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BLC').GetAdjective]  constitution and the consolidation of the Seven Republics into a single nation has thoroughly disproved that notion."
 dvg_belgium.9.f: "While we would prefer to focus on our own affairs the  [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BLC').GetAdjective]  admittance of the illegally occupied Plantagenian province of Vierset as the “Vierset Territory” has ignited a firestorm of anti-[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BLC').GetAdjective]  sentiment. This is a direct threat to our territorial integrity! If we allow it to go unchallenged then we would be condoning the annexation of our lands and who knows where that might lead? Already the east coast has seen a sharp resurgence of Louisianais nationalism with the small landholders hopeful that the Belgians might aid their cause. This is the beginning of a crisis."
 dvg_belgium.9.a: "Sanacomie has been and always will be [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective]!"

 dvg_belgium.10.t: "The Sanacomie Crisis"
 dvg_belgium.10.d: "The inclusion of Vierset within the unified Belgian nation has infuriated the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective]s. By officially confirming our annexation of the province we have given hope to the Louisianais nationalists we have given hope to the Louisianais nationalists."
 dvg_belgium.10.f: "Already several Louisianais groups within [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName] have begun agitating for independence and the Planteurs (Plantagenian slaveowning nobles) accuse us of orchestrating them. Furthermore the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective] border has seen a notable increase in military activity. So far no incursions have been made but both [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective]  and [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective] militias have made public remarks alluding to “foraging missions” which may soon commence. This is a serious matter but both of our nations remember the carnage of the Belgian Revolution and are not eager to repeat it. There may be further buildup before the eruption of this crisis"
 dvg_belgium.10.a: "When it does erupt, it shall echo across Arcadia."
 dvg_belgium.10.b: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('lions_ig').GetName]  convinces the States-General to seek mediation!"

 dvg_belgium.11.t: "A Mediation Conference in Porto Dandolo?"
 dvg_belgium.11.d: "We have received an unexpected offer from the wicked [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BLC').GetAdjective]s. The threat of war over Vierset has alarmed them and they wish to attempt a diplomatic resolution to the crisis. They have offered to convene a meeting in the neutral [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VEN').GetAdjective] colony of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ATH').GetName] at Porto Dandolo to resolve the Sanacomie Crisis without bloodshed."
 dvg_belgium.11.f: "Most are dismissive of this overture viewing it as a mere trick but several wealthy [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] are concerned about the loss of profits but several wealthy Planteurs are concerned about the loss of profi – er"
 dvg_belgium.11.a: "Shout the insolent [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BLC').GetAdjective] diplomat out of the foreign office!"
 dvg_belgium.11.b: "This will be interesting."

 dvg_belgium.12.t: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName] Refuses Mediation"
 dvg_belgium.12.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName] has completely rejected any attempts at diplomacy. "
 dvg_belgium.12.f: "Our representative in Nouvelle-France received a sharp rebuke from the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective] foreign minister who denounced our “trampling of the rights of a sovereign nation” and condemned our offer of mediation as a farce! The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('lions_ig').GetName]  has been publicly humiliated by the failure of their peace overtures while the Burgundians and the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName] gear up for the battle to come..."
 dvg_belgium.12.a: "At least we can say that we gave peace a chance!"

 dvg_belgium.13.t: "Porto Dandolo Conference"
 dvg_belgium.13.d: "The conference with [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName] in Porto Dandolo has turned out to be less successful than anticipated."
 dvg_belgium.13.f: "The mood in Porto Dandolo was unpleasant long before the meeting began. While choosing this location for the conference may have ensured that neither side held an advantage its oppressive heat and humidity soured everyone’s moods. The conference itself was even worse. The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective]s absolutely refused to recognize our sovereignty over Vierset demanding its immediate “return”, and furthermore blaming us for “inciting insurrection” in Louisiane. Our own delegates attempted to be patient with them but they finally grew tired of the  [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective]s’ antics and presented an ultimatum : surrender Sanacomie – the entire region – to us or face war. It seems that the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('pb_scope').GetName] and the Burgundian Leagues had made a secret agreement to authorize our delegation to make this threat if negotiations deadlocked. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('lions_ig').GetName]  is furious but now we can only wait for their reaction"
 dvg_belgium.13.a: "But I thought this was the era of diplomacy and etiquette…"

 dvg_belgium.14.t: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BLC').GetAdjective] Ultimatum"
 dvg_belgium.14.d: "The conference with [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName] in Porto Dandolo has turned out to be less successful than anticipated."
 dvg_belgium.14.f: "We went to Porto Dandolo in good faith despite the heat and humidity of the locale but the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BLC').GetAdjective]s proved unwilling to listen to reason. They ignored every attempt that we made to explain our rights to Vierset dismissing any pretense of the inviolable nature of our national sovereignty. Soon enough they showed their true colors and demanded that we surrender the entirety of Sanacomie to them! Our own diplomats have requested permission to terminate the conference and return home unless we wish to make a counter-demand and insist on the return of Vierset. Capitulating to the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BLC').GetAdjective]s could have dire consequencesboth for our government and our national stability...."
 dvg_belgium.14.a: "Yes lets end this farce and recall our diplomats!"
 dvg_belgium.14.b: "One good ultimatum deserves another! Demand Vierset!"
 dvg_belgium.14.c: "We cannot risk war!"


 dvg_belgium.15.t: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective] Response"
 dvg_belgium.15.d: "In answer to our own ultimatum the Cadiens have given us one of their own : return Vierset immediately and forfeit any claims on it and the rest of eastern Plantagenia or face war!"
 dvg_belgium.15.f: "The failure of the conference appears imminent and many believe that the time has come to terminate this endeavor and prepare for inevitable conflict. Capitulating to the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective]s could have dire consequences both for our government and our national stability..."
 dvg_belgium.15.a: "What a waste of time this was."
 dvg_belgium.15.b: "Surely peace is worth a single province?"

 dvg_belgium.16.t: "Failure of the Porto Dandolo Conference"
 dvg_belgium.16.d: "As most Planteurs expected, negotiations with the Belgians have broken down. They rejected any possibility of returning Vierset and both of our delegations returned home in frustration."
 dvg_belgium.16.f: "The pro-peace Planteurs have been publicly humiliated by this disgrace and war between our nations now appears inevitable"
 dvg_belgium.16.a: "We gave peace a chance. It didn’t work..."

 dvg_belgium.17.t: "Failure of the Porto Dandolo Conference"
 dvg_belgium.17.d: "As the Burgundian and the Old Arcadian Leagues expected negotiations with the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective]s have broken down. They rejected any possibility of returning Sanacomie or even recognizing our possession of Vierset and both of our delegations returned home in frustration."
 dvg_belgium.17.f: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('lions_ig').GetName]  has been publicly humiliated by this disgrace and war between our nations now appears inevitable..."
 dvg_belgium.17.a: "We gave peace a chance. It didn’t work..."


 dvg_belgium.18.t: "The Admission of Vierset"
 dvg_belgium.18.d: "The province of Vierset was originally admitted to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] as the “Vierset Territory” an ambiguous name to reflect its ambiguous status. Now that war with [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetName] over the region appears certain we have decided to formally admit the territory as a full state."
 dvg_belgium.18.f: "The only question is how exactly this should be done. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('lions_ig').GetName]  believes that it should be admitted under the name of the “State of Sanacomie” reflecting the legitimacy of our claim to the rest of the region. The Burgundians and the Roosters however have presented a competing bill recognizing the “petition for annexation” by the Louisiane Republic! Whichever way we choose to admit Vierset into the Confederation will be taken as a public signal of our aims in the war. Attempting to claim all of Louisiane may be beyond our abilities and could result in a negative outcome..."
 dvg_belgium.18.a: "Seven sisters shall become eight!"
 dvg_belgium.18.b: "All Louisiane shall fly the Belgian flag!"
 dvg_belgium.18.c: "Arcadia will see a new country on the continent."



 dvg_belgium.19.t: "Fausse Guerre"
 dvg_belgium.19.d: "While hostilities between the [SCOPE.sCountry('BLC_scope').GetName] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] are broiling - they have yet to formally escalate to war."
 dvg_belgium.19.f: "The Belgians seem to have armed Louisianais partisans in the hopes of either instigating a Louisianais revolution or at least hampering our own war effort when conflict eventually breaks out. We shall have to tackle this issue before confronting the Confederacy on the battlefield. §BIf we have not expended too many resources elsewhere – such as in Cymrie or the southwestern Great Lakes – then we stand a good chance of succeeding."
 dvg_belgium.19.a: "Mere distractions...nothing more."

 dvg_belgium.20.t: "Decisive Victory over the Louisianais Partisans!"
 dvg_belgium.20.d: "Louisianais guerillas were plotting to take over state governments and defect to the Belgians' cause, but have failed to do so."
 dvg_belgium.20.f: "The Louisianais guerillas have been crushed! With our comfortable reserves of resources and manpower we were able to divert sufficient forces into the eastern lands to root out the traitors and disarm them. Mounted patrols kept us informed of attacks and allowed us to intercept several partisan forces while they were in transit between bases. We were even able to induce some Catholic priests to give sermons in the region denouncing the Protestant Belgians stressing that if the Louisianais were to throw their lot in with the northerners they would be even worse off than before. These efforts have not eliminated Louisianais separatism but the threat of an armed insurrection collaborating with the Belgians has been ended..."
 dvg_belgium.20.a: "One less thing to worry about."


 dvg_belgium.21.t: "Constantin Leclère"
 dvg_belgium.21.d: "A celebrity commander has been making waves."
 dvg_belgium.21.f: "A young Planteur who has purchased a military commission has caught the attention of our high command. Constantin Leclère is a dashing and handsome figure with a short yet impressive record. In addition to participating in numerous raids on the natives he has served overseas with distinction in the Anglois Armée Royale. While he had been making plans to travel west with his brother Armand and establish a plantation in Cymrie the escalation of tensions with the Belgian Confederacy has instead caused him to enroll in the army as an officer. Leclère is a tall and powerfully built man with a bold forceful attitude and no small number of female admirers. If even half of the rumors of his conduct against the Indians and his service with the Anglois are true then he may have a keen grasp of strategy and tactics."
 dvg_belgium.21.a: "This man needs an army to command!"

 dvg_belgium.22.t: "Setback with the Louisianais Partisans"
 dvg_belgium.22.d: "Despite our best efforts we have not been able to fully eradicate the Louisianais guerillas."
 dvg_belgium.22.f: "We have identified several weapons caches arrested some notable leaders of the movement and foiled multiple plots to attack military forts and depots. This has reduced the danger posed by these partisans but not ended it. Patrols continue to report occasional harassing fire from the woods and several local politicians are believed to be corresponding with the Belgian government though nothing can be proven. We simply do not have the resources to fully root out all the guerillas in a timely manner. Our efforts against the Belgians will be made somewhat more difficult by all this."
 dvg_belgium.22.a: "Mission accomplished?"

 dvg_belgium.23.t: "Decisive Defeat against the Louisianais Partisans!"
 dvg_belgium.23.d: "Louisiane is in chaos. With our resources stretched thin across multiple areas we have not been able to make much progress at all against the guerillas."
 dvg_belgium.23.f: "Our forces moving through the east are constantly harried by fire from the woodlands local militias have refused to cooperate with the royal army and we have had to impose martial law across Louisiane. Even foreign sailors docking in eastern ports have grown noticeably wary of venturing too far into the cities for fear of being swept up in yet another outbreak of violent unrest. The only bright spot in all of this is that the clamor of Louisianais nationalism has somewhat drowned out abolitionism in the east as the white smallholders are prioritizing their own freedom over that of the slaves. When the Belgians come they shall find no lack of support"
 dvg_belgium.23.a: "Que Dieu punisse la Belgique!"
 dvg_belgium.23.b: "Nothing we can do about this..."


 dvg_belgium.24.t: "Military High Command Proposes a Lightning Offensive"
 dvg_belgium.24.d: "Our generals have drawn up plans for the invasion of Plantagenia. Currently their favored approach is a quick seizure of Sanacomie before consolidating our gains and pressing further south if conditions are right."
 dvg_belgium.24.f: " By attacking as soon as possible without giving the Plantagenians too much time to redirect their forces eastward we can catch them at minimal readiness. The risks of such a plan are twofold. First if our generals have overestimated our own preparedness then we might rush to war without the resources to sustain prolonged operations. Second if the Plantagenians are counting on drawing us into an extended defensive campaign pressing the attack so rapidly will only play into their hands. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('roosters_ig').GetName] and most of the Burgundians want to strike now but the Dutch and a vocal Burgundian minority favor a small delay to finalize our preparations."
 dvg_belgium.24.a: "Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war!"
 dvg_belgium.24.b: "Attacking so soon would be foolhardy continue our preparations."


 dvg_belgium.25.t: "The Battle of Fort Villefranche"
 dvg_belgium.25.d: "A company of militiamen from Base-Valoisy recently decided to carry out a “reconnaissance in force” near the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective] border."
 dvg_belgium.25.f: "Whether or not they intended to cross said border they soon ended up in Cadien territory and encountered a military base named Fort Villefranche. The fort’s sentries saw them as the militiamen were trying to verify whether it was [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] or [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective] – there was heavy rain and the fort’s flag was not clearly visible. A group of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PLA').GetAdjective] soldiers came out to confront them and what happened next is disputed. The survivors of the militia swear that they were leaving only for the Cadiens to attack them as they fled.

Centralizers are in turn divided as to whether the confederal government should merely assume further powers (the Dutch view) or if the individual republics・ governments should be dissolved and the nation fully centralized (the Burgundian view). Whichever group prevails in this convention will enshrine their values as the bedrock of Belgium."

The Burgundians have accused the Dutch of hypocrisy seeking to use centralization to strike at slavery while opposing further economic contributions into the national budget from the rich Northern states which most of them hail from. ｧRWhile allowing the ・Lions・ to leave would make it far easier to reform government finances it would also remove one of the two parties most fiercely opposed to Les Fiducies."

For these reasons they have threatened to stage a walkout from the convention unless the proposed new Constitution shifts from a unitary to a federal model. Their critics accuse them of attempting to thwart abolition ・ many  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('pb_scope').GetName]  are Southern slaveowners.

There has not been any case of a republic refusing to contribute money to the confederate budget but that could change at any time. If we ever want to unite Arcadia under our banner then we must establish a formal government revenue system. So far, however a cross-party opposition bloc has prevented such measures. The northerners in the Dutch League don・t want their money going to southern slave states and the southerners in the Burgundian League don・t want to pay for northern abolitionists.

However many corporations have begun to experiment with integrating slaves either Afro-Franks or rented convicts into their business models. While many recognize that slavery is a doomed institution in the long run conservatives have argued that immediate abolition would create even more chaos not to mention doubting that the confederal government can end slavery where it already exists. They have instead proposed that a deadline be set for all republics to abolish slavery within ninety-nine years.

Article 20 of the current Belgian constitution allows for a state of emergency to be proclaimed by the Stadtholder ・in the event of a State not fulfilling the duties imposed upon it by the Constitution or if public security is clearly endangered.・ The unilateral domestic powers given to the Stadtholder in this scenario effectively enables them to become a temporary dictator. While the States-General is in theory able to end the state of emergency at any time many liberals see the article as too dangerous. The Burgundians have defended the measure as a precaution against insurrection. The Dutch League demands the measure・s abolition but they recognize the danger of secession.
