 je_armenian_revolt: "Armenian Militancy"
 je_armenian_revolt_reason: "The Armenians have always considered themselves as a distinct people from the ruling Azeris. So long as they are discriminated against, the Armenians are likely to stage a revolt."
 je_armenian_revolt_goal: "If the Armenians are disenfranchised for long enough, they will revolt."

 je_sea_to_sea_armenia: "Restore the Empire of Tigranes the Great"
 je_sea_to_sea_armenia_reason: "After all we have accomplished, there will always be need for a protector of all Armenians and Christendom in the Near East. To that end we must lead our nation to its greatest heights and beyond, so that nobody will dare to threaten our kin again! Our ancestors once brought about an Armenian golden age under their king Tigranes the Great. And to this day none of our polities managed to ever exceed his Empire. It is only logical that we ought to build our eternal Armenia in the image of Tigranes' Empire! Then and only then will the reign of eagle and lion remain unbroken!"

 je_qashqai_revolt: "Tribal Domination of the Shekhbizin Army"
 je_qashqai_revolt_reason: "The Shekhbizin Army has been composed since its inception from Qashqai contingents. The tribal elite dominates the military sphere of the realm and would see the conscription of Persians into the army as an encroachment into their authority and privileges."

 je_soyurghal: "Dehqan Unrest"
 je_soyurghal_reason: "The Dehqan and the Soyurghal System used to support them is what has prevented the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] from losing even more land and power than it already has. If there was less of a dependency on them however, then perhaps the Soyurghal System can be done away with and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will have an easier time modernizing."

 je_karkiya_rule: "High Tide of Kar-Kiya"
 je_karkiya_rule_reason: "Many wonder if the Kiya dynasty hasn't reached its high water mark. The recently ascended [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has inherited an ossified realm with paralysingly corrupt bureaucracy  deep economic crisis due to the disruption of trade routes  and increasing religious unrest in Ajam as the Zaydi Shi'ite monarchy attempts to enforce its creed on a population split between Sunnism and the herectic Ismaili and Twelver sects of Shi'a Islam."

 je_kawaltiya_revolt: "Kawaltiya Insurgency"
 je_kawaltiya_revolt_reason: "Sheik Zayed has been preaching that the current government is illegitimate and that the country should be governed as a theocracy instead. If the population becomes discontent enough and the Kawaltiya have enough influence, they can become capable of overthrowing the current government."
 je_kawaltiya_revolt_goal: "If the Kawaltiya get too powerful long enough they can stage an uprising or overthrow the government."
 
 je_kawaltiya_insurgency: "Kawaltiya Insurgency"
 je_kawaltiya_insurgency_reason: "Sheik Zayed has been preaching that the current government is illegitimate and that the country should be governed as a theocracy instead. If the population becomes discontent enough and the Kawaltiya have enough influence, they can become capable of overthrowing the current government."
 je_kawaltiya_insurgency_goal: "If the Kawaltiya get too powerful long enough they can stage an uprising or overthrow the government."
 
 je_constitutionalist_revolt: "Constitutionalist Insurgency"
 je_constitutionalist_revolt_reason: "Under the current government, liberals and religious minorities find themselves disenfranchised. If they garner too much influence or if the populace becomes radical enough, the current government risks collapsing."
 je_constitutionalist_revolt_goal: "If the Constitutionalists get too powerful they can stage an uprising or overthrow the government."

 #Events
 
 dvg_persia.1.t: "Succession of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]"
 dvg_persia.1.d: "The ailing [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] is but a shadow of his former self, with disease steadily eroding the man that became the master of the Caucasus."
 dvg_persia.1.f: "Once a vassal petty Khan of the Timurtash Empire ruling over a small domain in the Kura river valley, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] exploited the power vacuum left by the Timurtash collapse by conquering the petty Khanates from Baku to Tabriz. \n \n With death creeping every closer to the Khan, succession must be secured  and a decision has to be made between his sons Ibrahim and Ahmad. Ibrahim is a proven military commander who proposed and led the invasion Gorjestan in the aftermath of the Turkish Civil War and sees the Khanate's future lying north of the Greater Caucasus Range. Ahmad on the other hand  has inherited the boundless ambition of his father  seeking a prize even greater than what his predecessor achieved - the vacant throne of the Iranian Shahanshah."
 dvg_persia.1.a: "Favor Ibrahim the subjugator of the Kartvelians!"
 dvg_persia.1.b: "Follow Ahmad Bey's dreams of becoming the Shah of Shahs"
 
 dvg_persia.2.t: "Wrath of the Highlands"
 dvg_persia.2.d: "Worrying news are reaching us from Eriwan. Our presence in the city and surrounding territories has been compromised. There are claims that warriors have come from the mountains  set on resuming the work of their fathers during the Turkish reign."
 dvg_persia.2.f: "Taking the war-banner of their martyr Joseph Emin, the Armenians have crowned one of their own,  Hiovannes Beglarian  alowly noble from Karabakh as their new king and are now threatening to drive us out of the region! How are we supposed to react to this uprising?"
 dvg_persia.2.a: "This insurrectionists shall kneel before us as their forefathers did!"
 dvg_persia.2.b: "Freedom for Armenia! Long live King Hiovannes!"
 dvg_persia.2.c: "They can have their will, but only if their king bends his knee to us!"

 dvg_persia.3.t: "The Qashqai Confederacy in Fars"
 dvg_persia.3.d: "During the wars against the Timurtash and Turkish Empires, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('qashqai_ig').GetName] were able to help the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] Dynasty consolidate power. "
 dvg_persia.3.f: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('qashqai_ig').GetName] are a Turkic tribal confederation that migrated to Iran centuries ago. Settled by the Timurtash Shahanshah in Fars to protect the southern coastlines against incursions from the Europeans. The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('qashqai_ig').GetName] has eventually come to dominate the military, economic, and political life in the region. Their power resides in their ability to control the trade routes between the capital in Shiraz and Isfahan and from then westwards into the Levant and between Shiraz and Kerman and then eastwards into India. Acting as both toll collectors and military-security forces in Fars. \n \n The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] Shah, whose capital resides in the heart of Qashqai territory depends on the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('qashqai_ig').GetName] Ilbeg's loyalty to rule."
 dvg_persia.3.a: "We will need to stay on the Ilbeg's good graces."

 dvg_persia.4.t: "The Tribes Rise in Rebellion"
 dvg_persia.4.d: "The unwritten social pact between the tribal constituencies of the Shekhbizin Empire has all but broken down as the Shah has moved to curb the power of the local Ilkans and Ilbegs. The attempts to force the tribes to settle down have met with fierce resistance  as has the reform of the Shekhbizin army into a force composed of urban Persians loyal to the Shah rather han Lurish and Qashqai soldiers with tribal affiliations. "
 dvg_persia.4.f: "Throughout Luristan, Khuzestan, and Fars the authority of the Shah is now void  and it seems that only the army can now restore order in the rebellious provinces,"
 dvg_persia.4.a: "The nomads shall be brought to heel in due time."
 dvg_persia.4.b: "Down with the Shah! Long live the Qashqai!"
 dvg_persia.4.c: "Let the tribes go their own way."

 dvg_persia.5.t: "Troubled Times Lay Ahead for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_persia.5.d: "The ripples of events in distant lands are starting to hit the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] domains,  turning the discontent in the realm against the monarchy. The German Revolution, although destroyed decades ago, is still alive in the hearts of the Western Merchants purchasing silk in Rasht who speak about its promises to overthrow despotism."
 dvg_persia.5.f: "All over the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] realm secret societies of intellectuals are organising and denouncing the decadent Arab influence on the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('zaydi_ig').GetName] state religion and glorifying Iran's pre-Islamic past. However, the opposition to the rule of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] is divided between the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('constitutional_ig').GetName] and the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('kawaltiya_ig').GetName] Order. \n \n The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('kawaltiya_ig').GetName] is a congregation of Islamic Mystics following a Shayk, and its persitence within the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] domains eventually led the Order to move closer over time to the heterodox [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('zaydi_ig').GetName]  Shi'a tennets of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] Amirs. Recently, their Shayk has started to preach herectic concepts such as the transmigration of souls and the renewal of the cycle of time through the coming of the Mahdi and the Order is starting to become a rallying point for the discontent elements of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] society. Meanwhile, among the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('constitutional_ig').GetName],  seditious talk spreads like wildfire as these societies encourage the disaffected subjects to throw off the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] yoke and liberate themselves through freedom of thought and progress. However, unlike the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('kawaltiya_ig').GetName] who want to establish a theocracy, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('constitutional_ig').GetName] are advocating for a more secular, liberal country."
 dvg_persia.5.a: "They shall have to be dealt with in due time."
 
 dvg_persia.6.t: "A House Divided"
 dvg_persia.6.d: "As the standard of living is declining and discontent has with the status quo in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] realm grows, the future of the country has been called into question."
 dvg_persia.6.f: "Whatever support the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Dynasty might have once enjoyed in the bazaars and in the mosques is evaporating by the minute. Already, there have been reports of rebel attacks in the Yahya shrine and protests stemming from the country's madrasahs. Already throughout the country and in the cities, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('constitutional_ig').GetName] are engaged in gang-like warfare against one another."
 dvg_persia.6.a: "Regardless, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] shall hold on!"
 dvg_persia.6.b: "Let us embrace the Kawaltiya."
 dvg_persia.6.c: "The age of monarchs and theocrats is over."
 
 dvg_persia.7.t: "Cession of Qeshm?"
 dvg_persia.7.d: "With a divided Persia, a colonial power has seen an oppurtunity to establish a foothold in the region."
 dvg_persia.7.f: "Qeshm, the cornestone of trade between the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean  has traditionally been a prized possession for any polity based in Fars. The island came recently under Shekhbizin domination after a short campaign which ousted the Hormuz Shahs  the erstwhile Timurtash vassals in the region  from power. Although Shekhbizin power extends for much of southern Iran  our position is far from secure with rivals to our north and east and our traditional enemies  tottering but still capable of going down fighting. The rapacious imperialists from Burgundy are well aware of this fact - and are now demanding that we cede Qeshm as a trade post in exchange for a minuscule percentage of the trade taxes."
 dvg_persia.7.a: "We have no choice - we will lease Qeshm."
 dvg_persia.7.b: "Bowing down will ruin our legitimacy."
 
 dvg_persia.8.t: "Negotiations Over Qeshm Fail"
 dvg_persia.8.d: "As the standard of living is declining and discontent has with the status quo in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] realm grows, the future of the country has been called into question."
 dvg_persia.8.f: "Whatever support the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Dynasty might have once enjoyed in the bazaars and in the mosques is evaporating by the minute."
 dvg_persia.8.a: "We shall take these Persian Despots down a peg."
 dvg_persia.8.b: "Qeshm is not worth spilling a single drop of our people's blood"

 dvg_persia.9.t: "The Kawaltiya Coup"
 dvg_persia.9.d: "The protests at the holy Yahya Shrine was the final sign that Shaik Zahed Rudbari, spiritual leader of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('kawaltiya_ig').GetName] Sufi Order, was waiting for."
 dvg_persia.9.f: "Having already accreted a large following in the destituted classes, Zahed has gathered his devotees and proclaimed himself to be the reincarnation of Imam Zayd ibn Ali, the martyr who revolted against the Umayyads and inspired the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('zaydi_ig').GetName] sm. The Shaik now intends to turn one of the core tenets of [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('zaydi_ig').GetName] sm against the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]: that [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('zaydi_ig').GetName] s have the moral imperative to rise against illegitimate and corrupt rulers.  Likening the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Amirs to the Umayyad Caliphs, Zahed urges his followers to storm the Lahijan Palace and exact vengeance from the man responsible for their suffering and deprivations."
 dvg_persia.9.a: "The ill-believers have recieved their due."
 
 dvg_persia.10.t: "The Constitutional Revolution"
 dvg_persia.10.d: "The simmering tensions between the Amir [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] and his subjects have finally erupted."
 dvg_persia.10.f: "The Amir's latest decree to further debase coinage - in a botched attempt to stem the currency shortage - has been met with outrage in the Lahijan Bazaar  where the merchants are joined by other [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] subjects from all walks of life  denouncing the monarchy's inability to alleviate the inflationary crisis that threatens to sink the middle class into poverty and the lower class into starvation. The crowd then marches to the Yahya ibn Abdallah shrine  where the leaders of the merchant community write a manifesto demanding the end of despotism and the establishment of a Consultative Council  to provide popular representation to all the social classes. With the Royal Army unwilling to fire on civilians in a Holy Shrine. Emir [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] must make a decision: bow down to the popular demands or request assistance from Cossacks."
 dvg_persia.10.a: "Accept the demands of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('constitutional_ig').GetName]."
 dvg_persia.10.b: "Unleash the Cossacks against the dissidents"
 
 dvg_persia.11.t: "The Kawaltiya Uprising"
 dvg_persia.11.d: "Shaik Zahed Rudbari, spiritual leader of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('kawaltiya_ig').GetName], had patiently waited in the sidelines as the conflict between reformists and royalists played out. Now that the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('constitutional_ig').GetName] have come on top, Zahed has finally decided it's time to mobilise his militant followers."
 dvg_persia.11.f: "Accusing the Provisional Government of ill-belief  and denouncing the proposed secular constitution to be incompatible with the holy Shari'a the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('kawaltiya_ig').GetName] march towards the Parliament in the old Lahijan Summer Palace."
 dvg_persia.11.a: "The Constituionalists and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]  Shall Prevail!"
 dvg_persia.11.b: "Parliament Shall be Reduced to Rubble!"
 
 dvg_persia.12.t: "Parliament Prevails"
 dvg_persia.12.d: "A handful of Daylamite Mountaineer soldiers with a single antiquated Light Howitzer is all that stands betweeen the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('kawaltiya_ig').GetName] mob and the Majles. A tense confrontation ensues in the walls in front of the Old Summer Palace as Shayk Zahed's exhortations for the soldiers to lay down their arms fall on deaf ears - the Daylamites."
 dvg_persia.12.f: "Belonging to the Ismaili sect, they  have little illusion of the fait that would await them under a [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('zaydi_ig').GetName]  theocracy. The situation finally comes to a violent resolution as Zahed Rudbari orders his acolytes to storm the Majles and the Daylamites put their Mountain Gun to good use, firing grapeshot over open sights and decimating the mob."
 dvg_persia.12.a: "Democracy stands triumphant with the Amir!"
 dvg_persia.12.b: "Democracy stands triumphant with a Prime Minister!"
 
 dvg_persia.13.t: "The Revolutionary Tide Recedes"
 dvg_persia.13.d: "In spite of the efforts by [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('kawaltiya_ig').GetName]  and [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('constitutional_ig').GetName], the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] Dynasty lives on."
 dvg_persia.13.f: "In the end, both movements failed to garner much support as the monarchy has shown it can persevere through the tumultuous times and lift its population out of poverty."
 dvg_persia.13.a: "Strength in Unity!"

 dvg_persia.14.t: "The Revolutionary Tide Recedes?"
 dvg_persia.14.d: "Months of heated debate have followed the establishment of the new Constitutional Regime which up until now lacked a proper Constitution to buttress the new order and delineate the divisions of power of the Kar-Kiya society. "
 dvg_persia.14.f: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('zaydi_ig').GetName], [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('kawaltiya_ig').GetName] , the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('constitutional_ig').GetName], the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('merchants_ig').GetName]  - all have tried to extract concessions from the others in an effort to either maintain or obtain privileges. The end result is a document that doesn't fully satisfy anyone."
 dvg_persia.14.a: "Hopefully the parliament can stay intact!"
 
 dvg_persia.15.t: "Bloodbath at the Yahya ibn Abdallah Shrine"
 dvg_persia.15.d: "After a few hours of tense deliberation, Amir [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has decided that only through the absolute power of the monarch can the Kar-Kiya domain be held together."
 dvg_persia.15.f: "The Cossacks show no qualms about massacring the Constitutionalists sheltering in the Yahya ibn Abdallah shrine. A precarious order is reestablished but the brutality of the act and the reliance on foreigners has made Rostam's weakness nakedly apparent to everyone in the Kar-Kiya realm."
 dvg_persia.15.a: "Harsh - but necessary - measures"

 dvg_persia.16.t: "The Last Breaths of an Empire?"
 dvg_persia.16.d: "The conquest of Transoxiana by [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_DZU').GetName] alongside the rebellions of Kurdish tribes, the Qashqai-aided [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SHZ').GetName], and [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_TEH').GetName] Zaydi nobles in Western Iran brought about the near collapse of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] central authority."
 dvg_persia.16.f: "The Empire only managed to hold on to a very reduced territory in Khorasan through bribing the local nobility, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('dehqan_ig').GetName], with privileges known as the Soyurghal. The Soyurghal is a system of land grants in which the holder of the appanage has the right to control taxes and muster local military forces.  while enjoying almost complete immunity to judicial interference from the Imperial centre in Herat. While decentralising the state and empowering the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('dehqan_ig').GetName] might have prevented total disintegration of the realm. The Shahanshah [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] II now finds himself nominal emperor over a collection of increasingly independent-minded [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('dehqan_ig').GetName]. "
 dvg_persia.16.a: "We shall restore central authority in due time."

 dvg_persia.17.t: "Death Knell for the Soyurghal System"
 dvg_persia.17.d: "The rebellion of the military governors of Khorasan has been crushed and the provinces west of the Murghab have been brought under direct Imperial control."
 dvg_persia.17.f: "Any Dehqans that supported the uprising have had their lands requisitioned and  pending a cadastral survey of the former Soyurghal lands  will be redistributed to small proprietors which will form the nucleous of a new landowning class loyal to the Emperor  rather than to the feudal lords. The Khorasani warlords were the holders of the three largest Soyurghal grants in the Empire and with them out of the picture  there is now little to hinder the Shahanshah in the hollowing out of Dehqan privilege and eventually the outright abolition of the appanage system."
 dvg_persia.17.a: "Our authority is now absolute!"

 dvg_persia.18.t: "The Abolition of the Mosallamiyat"
 dvg_persia.18.d: "With the Mosallamiyat abolished, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_ig').GetName] are not happy."
 dvg_persia.18.f: "Some say this could bring out a coup or an uprising, but with the armed forces not as powerful as they once were, what are they going to do?"
 dvg_persia.18.a: "Fairness and accountability for all!"

 dvg_persia.19.t: "The Establishment of Ismaili Schools"
 dvg_persia.19.d: "The Ismaili Da'i, now having permission to establish their own institutions within our country, are now able to educate the members of the Ismaili community in religious doctrine and possibly win worthy new converts."
 dvg_persia.19.f: "Ismaili madrasas teach not only theology, but also a miriad of secular subjects, and the tradition of preserving Ismaili heritage through manuscript study has kept literacy levels high within the community. It is in our best interest to protect the Da'i, and therefore the educative task they perform, even if that means infringing on the Dehqans administrative privileges."
 dvg_persia.19.a: "We can't let the Dehqans choose our realm's religious policy."

 dvg_persia.20.t: "The Enfranchisement of Armenians"
 dvg_persia.20.d: "Thanks to recent changes in our citizenship policies, Armenians are now considered citizens."
 dvg_persia.20.f: " Fellow people of the book can now adequately practice their faith and customs.  "
 dvg_persia.20.a: "Armenians will have a co-equal status with Azeris."
 dvg_persia.20.b: "Armenians are just as Azeri as all our other subjects."

 
 

  #Decisions

  demand_qeshm:0 "Demand A Treaty Port In Qeshm"
  demand_qeshm_desc:0 "The Island of Qeshm  sitting astride the strategic exit-point from the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean. It has been traditionally the key to dominating maritime trade with Iranshahr and has been hotly contested over the centuries by competing powers. Nominally governed by the Hormuz Shahs  this mercantile centre has come gone through intermitent domination by mainland Iranian polities, Omani Sheikdoms, and the faraway Imperial powers of Spain and Burgundy. After the fall of the Timurtash Empire the island was seized by the upstart Shekhbizin Shahs  who now have a tenuous hold over the entire northern shore of the Persian Gulf. We could offer the Shekhbizin a lease of Qeshm in exchange for a fixed percentage of the trade revenue - a scant deal  but one which we could push through with force if necessary."
  
  dvg_embrace_armenians:0 "Embrace the Armenians"

  dvg_embrace_persian:0 "Embrace a Persian Identity"
  dvg_embrace_persian_desc:0 "Much of our population already speaks the Persian language and we are on the outskirts of the region known as "Persia". It's time we embrace this identity by adopting Persian as our official language and further embrace the idea of our ruler becoming the Shah of Shahs."

  dvg_annex_georgians:0 "End Kartvelian Autonomy (Peacefully)"
  dvg_annex_georgians_desc:0 "The Principalities of Imereti and Samtskhe are the last remnants of the once mighty Bagrationi realm, shattered in the early XVI Century after a series of Mongol and Turkoman invasions devastated the region and splintered royal authority. Subsequently passing under Iranian and later Ottoman suzerainty, we are the current overlords of the Georgians. Directly annexing the Principalities would be a step forward in centralising the Khanate, to remove the restive Georgian nobility and give as direct access to the Black Sea ports. If we accept certain demands of theirs we can do this without a fight or the intervention of other powers."
