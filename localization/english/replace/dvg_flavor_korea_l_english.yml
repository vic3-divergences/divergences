  dvg_korea.2.t:0 "The Depletion of the Unsan Gold Mine"
  dvg_korea.2.d.g:0 "Unsan has been the biggest producer of gold in all of Asia for centuries, but all good times come to an end. Extensive prospecting and excavation exhausted all the gold deposits of Unsan. Miners and prospectors are leaving the region, and the once bustling mining towns of Unsan are left in disarray."
  dvg_korea.2.f.a:0 "It's been like that for a while, sir. We haven't been able to find new shafts for months, and most of my colleagues have given up and looking for new jobs. Some are still hoping for the prospectors to strike new deposits, but let's face it. The gold is no longer there."
  dvg_korea.2.f.k: "The Joseon dynasty annals, paragraph 3, $YEAR$, $MONTH$.\nThe Administrator of Pyeongan Blames Himself on the Gold Mine Incident and Requests to Resign\n\nJeong Seong-Hwa, The Administrator of Pyeongan, requested his resign regarding the recent events of Unsan, but his Majesty denied. Seong-Hwa's report was as follows:\nFor months, the Unsan gold mine failed to produce a single nugget of gold. Many households are struggling to find income, and this is to blame on this humble servant. I thereby request the punishment of my misdeeds.\nHis Majesty replied, the depletion of the mine is brought by myself. The blame shall not be placed on the administrator."
  dvg_korea.2.a:0 "This will trouble the local economy for years to come..."
  dvg_korea.2.k:0 "This will trouble the Royal budgets for years to come..."
  dvg_korea.3.t:0 "A Second Gold Rush in Unsan"
  dvg_korea.3.d:0 "For decades, the once-prosperous Unsan Gold Mine lay abandoned, its riches seemingly exhausted. However, recent advancements in mining technology—particularly the use of nitroglycerin and modern excavation machinery—have made it possible to access previously unreachable gold deposits. Miners are returning, and the region is once again abuzz with the promise of fortune."
  dvg_korea.3.f:0 "I never thought I'd see the day, sir! The mine was all but dead, yet here we are, striking gold again like in the old days!"

  dvg_korea.4.t:0 "The Forgotten Laborers of Unsan"
  dvg_korea.4.d:0 "With the depletion of the Unsan Gold Mine, countless laborers found themselves out of work and abandoned. Now, they gather before the royal court, demanding compensation for their years of toil and the hardship they now endure."
  dvg_korea.4.f:0 "We gave our sweat, our blood—some even their lives—digging gold for the kingdom. And now? Cast aside like broken tools! The court must answer, for we shall not be ignored."
  dvg_korea.4.a:0 "The state will provide aid to those who built its wealth."
  dvg_korea.4.b:0 "The mine is dry, and so is our treasury."
  dvg_korea.5.t:0 "Scapegoats of Unsan"
  dvg_korea.5.d:0 "With the gold of Unsan gone, resentment festers among the people. Many refuse to accept that nature itself is to blame and instead search for a scapegoat. Some whisper that the king's greed drained the mine, while others grumble that the court's mismanagement led to its ruin. If left unchecked, this discontent could spiral into unrest."
  dvg_korea.5.f:0 "It was not the earth that betrayed us, but the men who ruled over it! We toiled while they grew fat off our labor. Someone must answer for this!"
  dvg_korea.5.a:0 "Blame the king—let him bear the people's anger."
  dvg_korea.5.b:0 "Blame the court—bureaucratic mismanagement lead to this."
  dvg_korea.5.c:0 "Silence them. No good comes from stirring unrest."
  dvg_korea.6.t:0 "The Great Exodus"
  dvg_korea.6.d:0 "With Unsan's golden days gone, prospectors lost hope in their homeland. The once-thriving mining towns grow quieter as families pack their belongings, seeking opportunity elsewhere. Some look north, drawn to the vast and untamed lands of Manchuria, while others hear of gold shimmering in the rivers of a faraway land called Qingqiu. The winds of fate are shifting—where will they lead the people of Korea?"
  dvg_korea.6.f:0 "Now, there's nothing left. Some say there's land and work to the north, others dream of fortunes across the ocean. Either way, we can't stay here."
  dvg_korea.6.a:0 "North, to Manchuria!"
  dvg_korea.6.b:0 "West, to Buyeo!"
  dvg_korea.6.c:0 "We cannot just let them leave!"
  dvg_korea.7.t:0 "The Weight of Tradition"
  dvg_korea.7.d:0 "A group of Confucian scholars convenes to discuss the implications of their desires. They argue passionately that the traditional Confucian hierarchy, also known as the Four occupations, places the farmer at the forefront of society's needs, only below the Scholar-Officals. The scholars contend that while the mining industry may promise short-term wealth, it pales in comparison to the lasting value of agriculture and the stability it provides. The scholars urge the court that now is the right time to abandon the mining industry, and return to the old agrarian ways."
  dvg_korea.7.f:0 "Your Majesty, we must remember the teachings of our ancestors and the principle of the four occupations. The farmer, as the backbone of our society, must take precedence over all other pursuits. To neglect their plight is to undermine the very foundation of our kingdom. Mining and commerce may yield wealth, but it is the agrarian heart of our nation that sustains us. We must ensure that our agricultural community thrives, for without them, we are but a house built on sand."
  dvg_korea.7.a:0 "The farmer has always been paramount over the miners and businessmen."
  dvg_korea.7.b:0 "The mining industry will ultimately benefit the agrarian economy."
  dvg_korea.8.t:0 "A Glimpse into the Future"
  dvg_korea.8.d:0 "The court is abuzz with reports from learned advisors and envoys who have studied the ways of the Western world. They speak of wondrous machines—steam-powered drills, mechanized pumps, and explosive compounds—that allow miners to reach depths once thought impossible. Though Unsan's decline may be inevitable, some argue that investing in such knowledge could lead to the discovery of new gold deposits previously unavailable. Others scoff at the idea, dismissing these foreign devices as unnecessary and unproven."
  dvg_korea.8.f:0 "Your Majesty, we have seen these machines with our own eyes. They can carve through stone like a plow through soil! If we do not embrace this knowledge now, we may forever lag behind those who do."
  dvg_korea.8.a1:0 "The future belongs to those who adapt."
  dvg_korea.8.a2:0 "Let us further improve our machinery."
  dvg_korea.8.b:0 "The love for gunpowder is embedded in our tradition."
  dvg_korea.8.c:0 "Such contraptions have no place in our lands."
  dvg_korea.9.t:0 "Rumors of Untapped Riches"
  dvg_korea.9.d:0 "Despite the widespread belief that Unsan's wealth has been exhausted, a group of seasoned prospectors approaches the administrator of Yangseo with a bold claim. They insist that deeper, untouched veins of gold still lie beneath the earth, waiting to be uncovered. With the right funding and proper equipment, they argue, a new golden age could begin. However, skeptics warn that such efforts could be nothing more than a fool's errand, throwing good money after bad."
  dvg_korea.9.f:0 "We have spent our lives reading the land, and we swear to you—there is still gold in Unsan! Just grant us the tools, and we will unearth riches beyond imagination!"
  dvg_korea.9.a:0 "Fortune favors the bold."
  dvg_korea.9.b:0 "Enough wishful thinking—the mine is finished."
  dvg_korea.10.t:0 "Shattered Livelihoods"
  dvg_korea.10.d:0 "With the miners and prospectors gone, the lifeblood of Unsan's economy has dried up. Inns stand empty, merchants struggle to sell their goods, and craftsmen find fewer customers by the day. Once-thriving businesses now teeter on the brink of collapse. Without gold to draw people in, the region must either find a new way to sustain itself or risk fading into obscurity."
  dvg_korea.10.f:0 "They came for the gold, but we built our lives here. Now, they leave without a second thought, and we are left with nothing but debts and empty streets. If Unsan is to survive, something must change."
  dvg_korea.10.a:0 "If the land won't yield gold, let it yield grain."
  dvg_korea.10.b:0 "Pyeongan has always been a place for fine artisanry"
  dvg_korea.10.c:0 "The market will sort itself out."
  dvg_korea.11.t:0 "The Golden Curse"
  dvg_korea.11.d:0 "As the abandoned mineshafts of Unsan fall deeper into disrepair, they become a source of pollution, leaching harmful substances into the soil and water. The air grows thick with dust, and the once-healthy landscape is marred by the scars of industry. Local residents complain of ailments, and the specter of environmental catastrophe looms. The court faces a pressing decision; address the growing crisis or let the mines fester as a dark reminder of the past."
  dvg_korea.11.f:0 "The gold diggers left with their shares, but all we got was this polluted land. Every day the air feels heavier, and the river is no longer safe to drink. If something doesn't change soon, we'll be paying for these mistakes for generations."
  dvg_korea.11.a:0 "The government will take care of its people."
  dvg_korea.11.b:0 "We must hold those gold diggers accountable!"
  dvg_korea.11.c:0 "Why bother? Ignore the issue."
  dvg_korea.12.t:0 "The Weight of Gold"
  dvg_korea.12.d:0 "As the seasons change, the court of Japan issues its annual demand for tribute from Korea, as customary for the suzerain. However, with the Unsan gold mine depleted and the economy in decline, the Korean treasury is nearly empty."
  dvg_korea.12.f:0 "We cannot be seen as weak; to defy Japan is to invite their wrath. But if we cannot meet their demands, what will become of our people? Honor is important, but so is survival."
  dvg_korea.12.a:0 "Negotiate for a reduced tribute—there's no shame in asking for understanding during hard times."
  dvg_korea.12.b:0 "Perhaps the emperor might accept a symbolic gift."
  dvg_korea.12.c:0 "Let them come to us. We cannot bow to Japan when our people suffer."
  dvg_korea.13.t:0 "Untapped Riches: The Second Gold Rush"
  dvg_korea.13.d:0 "The prospectors of Unsan found a major gold vein yet to be touched by mining activities."
  dvg_korea.13.f:0 "This can only be explaiend by Heaven's grace. Joseon's fate is yet to meet its demise!"
  dvg_korea.13.a:0 "Use it wisely to secure the future of our realm."
  dvg_korea.14.t:0 "Untapped Riches: Minor Success"
  dvg_korea.14.d:0 "The prospectors of Unsan found a some minor gold deposits around the mining towns of Unsan. Not impressive, but enough to make up for their costs."
  dvg_korea.14.f:0 "The earth has granted us fortune once more, but it seems like fortune alone cannot save the fate of Unsan."
  dvg_korea.14.a:0 "At least they were able to make up to their words."
  dvg_korea.15.t:0 "Untapped Riches: Failure"
  dvg_korea.15.d:0 "The prospectors of Unsan searched for weeks, using the finest tools and skilled personnel, but all came down to a halt. It seems like no gold remains in Unsan, and they have failed miserably."
  dvg_korea.15.f:0 "Unsan now stands eerily silent. Abandoned homes, rusting equipment, and empty streets serve as a haunting reminder of the wealth that once flowed through the region."
  dvg_korea.15.a:0 "Curses!"
