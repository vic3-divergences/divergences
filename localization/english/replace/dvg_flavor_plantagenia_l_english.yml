  dvg_plantagenia.1.f: "Ever since the unexpected death of King Édouard I de Orleans several years ago his young son [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]  I has had a regency council operating the government in his stead. This has kept the bare minimum of the government running but the lack of central leadership and the overall sense of an unknown future has left many [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] feeling wary of their own government. The Peculiar Institution (the chattel slavery of Afro-Frankish peoples in  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]) the opposition of the Queen-Regent  to it and the relations with the indigenous peoples are all putting pressure on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] society and its entrenched Planteur power structure.

  dvg_plantagenia.2.f: "“Le Sens Commun” or “Common Sense” written by an anonymous author the pamphlet is a denouncement of monarchism. It condemns many aspects of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] government such as hereditary rule of the king and the  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] the legislature’s subordination to the aristocracy and the general lack of accountability to the people. The pamphlet also points out passages in the Bible which can be construed to be arguments against monarchism. The work finished by taking stock of Louisiane’s resources and highlighting the ways in which they could be used in a revolutionary war against the Crown! “Le Sens Commun” is rapidly gaining readers across the east coast a trend that will continue unless we address its criticisms."

  dvg_plantagenia.3.f: "Louis may be a young king but he must learn quickly. With his anti-slavery mother Queen Catherine no longer the head of state various factions are beginning to emerge seeking to influence him. Those who support or oppose slavery those who seek war against the natives or against the Belgians even those who desire an end to the monarchy…There are many who seek Louis as a pawn to be captured and used against their rivals." # The Bible

His ability to perform his functions as monarch are in decline. Speculation and scheming surrounds the matter of succession and the future of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] government."
  dvg_plantagenia.4.f: "Entropy comes for all things, great and small. Whether by sword or decay, the King of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was destined to meet an end.

To avert rebellion monarchists have met with Louisianais politicians to draft a new legal document to enshrine the rights of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective]. "

Tens of thousands lined his funeral procession, wearing black and flying [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] flags. Dignitaries from as far as Japan bore witness to the event, each laying forth their own tokens of respect.\n\nThe heavy crown that once harrowed [SCOPE.sCharacter('new_brz_monarch_scope').GetHerHis]'s father now loomed over [SCOPE.sCharacter('new_brz_monarch_scope').GetHerHis].

  dvg_plantagenia.9.d: "Nouvelle-Orleans is optimally situated in terms of commerce the natural trade hub of the Carribbean and southern Arcadia with a commanding position on the Mississippi River. Unfortunately it is also quite vulnerable to hurricanes the massive tropical storms which occasionally sweep into the Caribbean. "
  dvg_plantagenia.9.f: "Lying on a floodplain at the bottom of a coasetal valley Nouvelle-Orleans’ surrounding environs are essentially a giant bowl : if the levies on the river fail nothing stands in the way of its flooding. A few days ago a giant storm made landfall on the coast. With little time to react many Nouvelle-Orleaners were caught in the maelstrom of pounding rain and winds strong enough to embed splinters of wood in hardened cement! Our nation’s beautiful capital has been devastated and it will take months for all the damage to be repaired. To say nothing of the lives lost..."
  dvg_plantagenia.9.a: "The price we pay for living in Nouvelle-Orleans is steep"
 
  dvg_plantagenia.10.t: "Commanches Raid Saint Sauveur"
  dvg_plantagenia.10.d: "The Commanches are an especially ferocious tribe living on the western plains. Though they are too decentralized to launch organized conquests like the Inca of Ameriga they still possess the skill and coordination to conduct brutal attacks against the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] frontier."
  dvg_plantagenia.10.f: "This morning we received word that another Commanche assault had occurred in the town of Saint Sauveur. It came at dusk just after the sun had set. Commanche braves on horseback descended upon the town picking off lone [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] and brutalizing the settlers who attempted to defend the area. It was only the timely intervention of a local frontier patrol which prevented them from pillaging the whole town though they still managed to escape. They inflicted severe damage and it will take months for Saint Sauveur to recover."
  dvg_plantagenia.10.a: "Damned Savages!"
  dvg_plantagenia.10.b: "This land belongs to the Commanche!"
 

  dvg_plantagenia.11.t: "Saint Sauveur Raided Again!"
  dvg_plantagenia.11.d: "As the Commanche raids persist on our western frontier, the question of where to distribute our forces has been raised."
  dvg_plantagenia.11.f: "In an act of astonishing temerity the Commanche savages have attacked Saint Sauveur less than a month after their last incursion! This time the raid came just before dawn. While most townspeople were still asleep another horde of Commanche braves rode straight into the town. Since the last raid many townspeople had acquired weapons and so were better prepared to fight. The result was street-by-street fighting between settlers and Commanches and the reduced amount of looting was balanced out by the increased bloodshed across the town. The incident has animated westerners against the tribes of the frontier and now western politicians are now calling on the government to take a stronger stance on the Commanche threat and pacify the west. §RYet if we do so we would be moving away men and resources that might otherwise be allocated defending against the Belgians who seek to reclaim their lost southern lands..."
  dvg_plantagenia.11.a: "Send in more cavalry against the Commanche."

  dvg_plantagenia.12.d: "King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]  has recently been touring his new domain familiarizing himself with the land and its people while building popular support for the monarchy."
  dvg_plantagenia.12.f: "His recent stop in the growing town of La Galette however seems to have awakened something within the young monarch. While he had visited La Galette for the purpose of officially designating it as a royal city he has been enraptured by this “Gateway to the West.” He spent quite a bit of time inspecting the outlands of the region much to the shock of the locals and even conducted some of his tours while riding on horseback. All in all the frontier life seems to suit the “boy king” quite well..."
  dvg_plantagenia.12.a: "How gauche!"

  dvg_plantagenia.13.t: "Lord of the Plains"
  dvg_plantagenia.13.d: "Louis’ time in La Galette has affected him even more profoundly than had first been thought. In the weeks since the end of his national tour he has made several trips out to the frontier often upon his own horse"
  dvg_plantagenia.13.f: "Frontier towns and settlements across the plains have become accustomed to the sight of the king riding into town  his entourage scrambling to follow. Louis particularly enjoyed engaging in buffalo hunts with royal Indian auxiliaries to the point where his white minders were somewhat embarrassed by the familiar and fraternizing manner with which he treated them. Nouvelle-Orleans and the other cities of culture and refinement back west have been astonished by the king’s plebian activities but he has befriended quite a few influential politicians and family patriarchs in the region. What’s more the image of the dashing young “Roi-Vacher” riding across the plains with the same attire and attitude as the other frontiersmen is quickly winning the hearts of the people of northwestern [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
  dvg_plantagenia.13.a: "A cowboy king? What is this world coming to?"

  dvg_plantagenia.14.t: "The Planteur Aristocracy"
  dvg_plantagenia.14.d: "Every monarchy has a noble class which must be managed but the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] aristocracy wields tremendous power in comparison to the nobility of other nations."
  dvg_plantagenia.14.f: "Hailing from English and French bloodlines of the highest pedigre these men and women control enormous plantations employing hundreds of slaves. The conditions upon these fields are said by radical liberals to be utterly brutal dominated by torture and violence. The  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] however, swear up and down that they are the preservers of chivalry tending to their slaves with the benevolence of a parent. As codified in the Second Charter of 1814 the censitary vote system weighs the impact of slaveowners according to their slaves even though the slaves themselves cannot vote. This means that the upper house is completely dominated by  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] interests and the lower house thoroughly influenced by them as well. Resentment is building against the  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] but at the moment their position is difficult to assail."
  dvg_plantagenia.14.a: "A toast to our lords and ladies."

  dvg_plantagenia.15.t: "The Knight of Saint Georges"
  dvg_plantagenia.15.d: "Sir Louis La Fayette de Saint Georges is a scion of a noble family which accompanied the Anglois Charles I to Arcadia. Unlike many mulattos he is technically legitimate as his father married his slave mother in secret. Sent to Europe for his studies he fought for the liberals in the Hungarian Revolution. The existence of “yellow” (mulatto) nobles has long irritated the  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] but Sir Saint-Georges is now spreading ideas of racial equality unheard of in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]..."
  dvg_plantagenia.15.f: "“It is not enough to say ‘I am a man.’ I am a man of noble blood white and black together noble not despite my African heritage but BECAUSE of it. I feel no shame in being a mulatto because there is none. Is a mulatto not a man and a brother? Shall you weigh the hearts of all yellow men bestowing rights upon one but not another because of an insufficient quantity of European blood? If a man of European paternity and noble birth can be denied freedom then no man in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] not even the richest master of enslaved negros is free.” "
  dvg_plantagenia.15.a: "All men were “created equal?” Sounds dangerous to me..."

  dvg_plantagenia.16.t: "The Loi Jaune and its Consequences"
  dvg_plantagenia.16.d: "Despite the best efforts of the  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] the frequency of racial intermixture between Whites and Blacks has given rise to a class of “yellow” or mulatto peoples within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Their existence has proved vexing to the traditional racial dichotomy of European Whites above and Blacks and the Natives below."
  dvg_plantagenia.16.f: "To maintain the Planteur power structure the Loi Jaune or “Yellow Law” has been on the books in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] for decades. The law sharply curtails the civil liberties of free mixed-race people despite a notable amount of them physically appearing to be just as white as any Planteur. Many Mulattoes are now agitating for the repeal of the Loi Jaune especially due to the influence of the Knight of Saint Georges who has made the repeal of the law his first political priority."
  dvg_plantagenia.16.a: "Could [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] even survive a future without such protections?"

  dvg_plantagenia.17.d: "For centuries, the Sacred Order of Saint Ignatius of Loyola or simply the Jesuits has been carrying out missionary work among the tribes of the Great Lakes"
  dvg_plantagenia.17.f: "Unlike many missionaries the Jesuits immerse themselves in native cultures. They learn and speak their languages adopt their ways and live amongst them to gain their trust and evangelize in ways that natives can understand. Many tribes have not been receptive but the Jesuits have seen great success working with the southern Algonquins of the Southwestern Confederacy. They have converted many Indians to the Catholic faith even if the Indians don’t always uphold the proper rites. Now however as tensions rise across Scandinavian Arcadia some believe that the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SKR').GetAdjective] Confederacy may collapse. If that happens then the Jesuit networks could enable us to attempt to take control of the Southwestern Confederacy. Doing this would divert resources being used to prepare for a potential war with the Belgians..."

  dvg_plantagenia.18.t: "Rebirth of the Fils de la Liberté"
  dvg_plantagenia.18.d: "Decades ago the Belgian Revolution saw the Belgian Confederacy break free from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] rule. Louisiane the Atlantic coast of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] joined them in their revolt fomented by a revolutionary group known as the Fils de la Liberté or “Sons of Liberty.” "
  dvg_plantagenia.18.f: "In the years since our recovery of the region Louisiane nationalism had receded but never truly died. Now it seems to be resurgent. We have discovered that a second Fils de la Liberté organization has been formed with some members believed to be the sons or grandsons of the original conspirators. Animated by the liberal ideologies of the Great German Wars the Fils are republicans who demand an end to the monarchy to the concentration of power in the hands of the Nouvelle-France elite of central [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and to the “Plantagenian occupation” of Louisiane. Drawing support from the small landowners in Louisiane the group’s fusion of Louisianais nationalism and militant republicanism could jeopardize our stability and territorial integrity."
  dvg_plantagenia.18.a: "Damned rabble-rousers!"

  dvg_plantagenia.19.t: "The King’s View"
  dvg_plantagenia.19.d: "The rise of the Fils de la Liberté has caused King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] to question his role as monarch. Up until now the Second Charter of 1814 has limited the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] king’s ability to directly influence politics."
  dvg_plantagenia.19.f: "Drafted by those who endured the mad ambitions of Charles II’s bid to become Emperor of Arcadia the Charter was intended as a compromise with the more liberal east coast. It confirms the king’s status as head of state but still remands significant powers to the legislature along with codifying the individual rights to life and property of the average [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] citizen. Yet the King wonders must these “rights to property” include slavery? Is that not a perversion of justice? Could opposing slavery break the stranglehold of Nouvelle-France? Though the  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] will abhor it many monarchists believe that the time has come for the King to take a more active role in politics and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] is starting to agree with them..."

  dvg_plantagenia.20.f: "“The maintenance of constant vigilance against the enemies of Our nation is Our firm commitment. We endeavor to defend Plantagenia with all Our power and know that Our subjects do the same. Yet as We consider the threats to Plantagenia We see one rise above the rest one internal rather than external. We believe that the Peculiar Institution degrades both the social and the productive power of our nation : it makes us serfs of moral prejudice. Rather than providing a sound foundation for the realm it is a foundation of sand. It may beguile from a distance but apply force to it and it dissipates and woe to the house which rests upon it. Shall we build our houses upon sand when our neighbors build their fortresses upon iron?” – King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] I\n\nThe King has recently made a shocking speech in Rosalie in which he has suggested that slavery is both immoral and placing our financial and national security in jeopardy!

  dvg_plantagenia.21.t: "Sic Semper Tyrannis"
  dvg_plantagenia.21.d: " [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]’ recent denouncement of slavery has drawn severe criticism from the Planteur aristocracy. A recent pamphlet circulating in Nouvelle-Orleans and other nearby cities “Sic Semper Tyrannis : On the Matter of Despotism and Liberty” typifies this reaction."
  dvg_plantagenia.21.f: "It is a scathing denouncement of the ways in which King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] I is supposedly grasping for power declaring him to be “the MAD DESPOT Charles the Second come once again upon the world to clench the nation in his mailed fist and CRUSH with all his Strength the vitality from its people!” The work equates [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]’ criticisms of slavery with a desire to destroy the Charter eliminate civil liberties and become an unchallenged autocrat. The pamphlet ends on an ominous note : “If we cannot find protection from the Crowned Heads which WE THE PEOPLE have charged to defend our lives and our property then it may be necessary to WATER THE TREE OF LIBERTY WITH THE BLOOD OF TYRANTS.”"

This would win Louis the loyalty of colored [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] including influential mulattos like Saint-Georges. It would also infuriate the  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] to the point that they could likely pass a law to abolish the monarchy on the grounds of what they would likely frame as Louis’ “gross overreach of power.” The other less extreme option would be to issue a new royal charter to expand civil liberties undermining the Planteurs’ power without challenging them head on. This would improve Louis’ opinion with the white middle class the Louisianais especially but would mean letting slavery go unchallenged.."
  dvg_plantagenia.22.a: "The time has come to end this vile enterprise!"

  dvg_plantagenia.23.d: "The law abolishing slavery has officially been passed in Plantagenia."
  dvg_plantagenia.23.f: "“Article 1 : From the date of this law, slavery is declared extinct in Plantagenia. Article 2 : All dispositions to the contrary are revoked...” \n\n King Louis I has signed into law the shortest and most significant bill in Plantagenian history. Drafted by his Minister of Justice Jean de Beauregard the “Declaration on the Extinction of Slavery in Plantagenia” or simply the “Golden Law” has immediately and unconditionally ended slavery in Plantagenia. Its proclamation has broken like a thunderstorm upon the country. Liberals are ecstatic as are the men of color but the Planteurs are beside themselves with fury. Many Planteurs are enraged at the notion of abolition while others are shocked that the King has not even offered them financial compensation for their slaves. Rumors abound as to how they will react but republicanism seems to be sweeping the upper classes..."
  dvg_plantagenia.23.a: "A nation redeemed?"

  dvg_plantagenia.24.t: "The Cowboy King"
  dvg_plantagenia.24.d: "Louis I was not about to take the Planteurs’ seizure of power lying down. He has withdrawn west to the frontier where the “Roi-Vacher” is beloved and declared the Kingdom of Oumessourita! Already he is rallying the frontier to his banner to destroy the “oligarchic insurrection.” Many soldiers are defecting to them heading west to join the Lord of the Plains."
  dvg_plantagenia.24.f: " “Four score years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation one which has been long wandering in the wilderness. Now the time has come to bear the torch of liberty and the sword of justice into a land long darkened by the shadows of tyranny that it might be brightened by our coming. Let all who stand with us have one determination : that our free destiny shall be made manifest by our striving—that our nation under God shall at last be liberated—and that government of all people by all people for all people shall not perish from the earth!” – Declaration of La Galette "
  dvg_plantagenia.24.a: "We'll shout the battle cry for freedom!"
  dvg_plantagenia.24.b: "We'll make our stand in Cadien land!"


  dvg_plantagenia.25.t: "The Louisianais Revolt"
  dvg_plantagenia.25.d: "As if the antics of “Le Roi-Vacher” were not enough now we are also faced with an eastern insurrection! The small landowners of Louisiane disowning Louis but also dreading the entrenchment of an “unchecked slavocracy” or some such nonsense have rallied under the leadership of a charismatic lowborn general named George Lafitte. Many soldiers are defecting to their odious liberal insurrection."
  dvg_plantagenia.25.f: "“We hold these truths to be self-evident : that all men are created equal and endowed with inalienable rights by their Creator among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness…Having been subjected to a litany of injustices denied our dignity by a government which possesses neither the merit nor the right to govern we take for ourselves the ancient freedoms of our forefathers and reclaim our honor.” – Declaration of Louisianais Independence."
  dvg_plantagenia.25.a: "Rebel scum."
  dvg_plantagenia.25.b: "Give me Louisiana!"


  dvg_plantagenia.26.t: "A House Divided"
  dvg_plantagenia.26.d: "Unable to reconcile its internal issues, Plantagenia has become divided."
  dvg_plantagenia.26.f: "“A house divided against itself cannot stand. I do not believe that this realm can permanently endure half slave and half free. I do not believe that the house shall fall – I do not believe that the realm shall be dissolved – but I do believe that it shall cease to be divided. It must become all one thing or all the other. Either the spirit of freedom shall anoint our body politic or we shall all regardless of color be bound by the shackles of slavery.” – King Louis I\n\nIt is over. All attempts at compromise at reconciling the issues of abolitionism regionalism and democracy have failed. This morning President  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] officially declared an insurrection to exist in the east and the west of Plantagenia with the representatives from both Oumessourita and Louisiane having already withdrawn to their respective homelands. Nouvelle-France remains loyal and the northern Indian lands have been placed under martial law but a prairie wind and a coastal gale both blow hard on our house divided."
  dvg_plantagenia.26.a: "Viva la Republique!"
  dvg_plantagenia.26.b: "Maybe a house divided does not need to stand."


  dvg_plantagenia.27.t: "Victory of the Loyalists"
  dvg_plantagenia.27.d: "Tensions regarding abolitionism and republicanism are reaching a fever pitch within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. If the government does not address either movement it may find itself overthrown. Louis and his council have held several meetings to address the situation and two solutions have arisen both involving the use of the royal prerogative."
  dvg_plantagenia.27.f: "At last, the Planteurs and the Louisianais rebels have been vanquished! Louis I has returned to Nouvelle-Orleans in triumph its treasonous tricolor banners now nowhere to be seen. The traitorous “Annulment Act” which sought to uphold slavery and destroy the monarchy has been declared illegal the Kingdom restored and abolition confirmed. In fact one of the first tasks of the restored legislature has been to pass the “Law of Equality” transforming Plantagenia even further. This new law enshrines equal protection under the law for Afro-Frankish people within Plantagenia ensuring that Plantagenians of color will be properly defended by the government. Plantagenia has awoken from the nightmare of slavery and civil war into a new and more perfect nation!"
  dvg_plantagenia.27.a: "E pluribus unum!"

  dvg_plantagenia.28.t: "St. George's Raid"
  dvg_plantagenia.28.d: "While we have been preparing to deal with the Oumessouritans it appears that other intrigues are afoot. Sir Louis La Fayette de Saint Georges gathered a group of like-minded Black and White men and led an attack on a national arsenal!"
  dvg_plantagenia.28.f: "According to several raiders captured during the incident he had originally planned to take and hold the arsenal as a base of operations to incite slave revolts in the area but changed his plans after learning more about the facility and the local garrison. A few days ago around two dozen rebels descended upon the armory cut the telegraph lines and detained a train which attempted to pass through the area. Word was spread among slaves in the region who fled their bondage and rallied to join Saint-Georges. The influx of manpower allowed him to make his escape just as the Tasralousan militia arrived. The rogue knight now has hundreds of men and thousands of guns at his disposal and Planteurs across the nation are horrified..."
  dvg_plantagenia.28.a: "The madman!"

  dvg_plantagenia.29.t: "The Plains Republic"
  dvg_plantagenia.29.d: "Interrogation of men captured from Saint-Georges’ raid has revealed that this attack was merely the first part of a plan to ignite a general insurrection of slaves across eastern Acadienie."
  dvg_plantagenia.29.f: "If this is true then we may soon find ourselves in a struggle for our way of life against the savage hordes of the bondsmen. Some are now suggesting that we should allow Oumessourita to go unmolested while we steel ourselves for the battle to come. Recognizing their independence would be a severe blow to Acadien national sovereignty but the notion of fighting a two-front war with the vachers of the west and the slaves of the east is not a pleasant one."

  dvg_plantagenia.30.t: "We are Free"
  dvg_plantagenia.30.d: "It seems that the Planteurs were even more cowardly than we had expected. Rather than challenge our independence they have recognized us as the newest nation in Arcadia."
  dvg_plantagenia.30.f: "Rumors allege this is due to the looming threat of a slave revolt in eastern Acadianie but whatever the causeOumessourita may now forge its own destiny!"
  dvg_plantagenia.30.a: "Yeehaw!"

  dvg_plantagenia.31.t: "The Libérien Revolution"
  dvg_plantagenia.31.d: "As expected the Planteurs did not accept our newfound freedom. They have declared Oumessourita to be “the location of an existing insurrection” and have mustered their forces to attempt to subjugate us once more."
  dvg_plantagenia.31.f: "For hundreds of years the descendants of African slaves have endured toil and torture for their French masters across southeastern Arcadia. Though aspiring to freedom only the lucky few could save themselves. Now however, the moral arc of the universe appears to be curving towards the children of Africa to their elevation and their old masters’ ruination. The efforts of radical mulattos like Sir Saint-Georges to arm slaves and marroons against the central government combined with raids by enterprising abolitionists has transformed into something never seen. What has occurred in the east as the entire apparatus of the national government recoils westward is not just another raid, but a revolution which has established an insurrectionary nation. Built and governed by Afro-Franks for Afro-Franks its advent has shaken white society worldwide. The Planteurs call it Hell and the Europeans call it anarchy but its new citizens call her by the name of their dream."

  dvg_plantagenia.33.t: "The Failure of the Reform Act"
  dvg_plantagenia.33.d: "Tensions amongst White Plantagenians  particularly between the upper classes of New France and the emerging middle class of the Louisianais smallholders are threatening to tear the nation apart."
  dvg_plantagenia.33.f: "To avert rebellion monarchists had met with Louisianais politicians to draft a new legal document to enshrine the rights of White Plantagenians. Proposals included a massive expansion of voting rights for White men of all classes and the protection of the right to freedom of assembly. The loss of censitary suffrage however, proved to be too radical for the legislature to stomach and the bill was unceremoniously killed on the upper house floor. The Louisianais and lower- and middle-class whites nationwide are outraged at the Planteurs’ blatant quashing of democracy. Peaceful measures to curtail the Planteurs’ power seem doomed by their stranglehold on the legislature and now even White citizens are calling for more forceful action to obtain their rights."
  dvg_plantagenia.33.a: "Damned Plebeians!"

  dvg_plantagenia.34.t: "The Liberty Battalions"
  dvg_plantagenia.34.d: "Rising national tension has caused an increased recruitment among local militias but Sir Saint-Georges’ latest creation is another beast entirely."
  dvg_plantagenia.34.f: "The baron has been gathering free men of color into what he calls his “Liberty Battalions” non-governmental militias recruited from Saint-George’s home state of Alibamon. While he claims that they are merely devoted to protecting colored freemen against racist attacks, nearly all Planteurs are convinced otherwise. Rumors abound that they are spreading propaganda against the government and the Planteurs and that these Battalions will form the core of an insurrectionary colored army. Recently Alibamon Governor Armand Leclerc signed off on a warrant to arrest the baron for treason due to the militia’s formation but he and many militia members seem to have gone underground. A manhunt is ongoing."

  dvg_plantagenia.35.d: "The traitorous Liberty Battalions have finally attacked! The blow fell upon Fort Toulouse a coastal Alibamon bastion near the city of the same name"
  dvg_plantagenia.35.f: "Early in the morning a column of colored militia headed towards the front gates carrying an unfamiliar flag. When asked to identify themselves and state their business they declared that they were the “First Infantry Regiment of the Libérien Republic” and demanded the surrender of the fort! The commander refused causing the militia to lay siege. Unfortunately the fort was intended to defend against coastal rather than land attacks and the garrison was small due to no expected action. The Battalions were able to blast open a side entrance whereupon their forces poured in grabbed all the munitions they could carry and departed. Fighting a rearguard action against the Alibamon militia as they left they seem to have split up and dispersed somewhere west of Talahasi. Saint-Georges now has considerable amounts of weaponry and ammunition at his disposal."

  dvg_plantagenia.36.f: "The Liberty Battalions under the rogue mulatto Sir Saint-Georges are believed to have dispersed across the northeast distributing weaponry to the maroons and recruiting them into their ranks. Armed groups of marroons have now been spotted venturing out of the forests launching raids on plantations to rescue what slaves they can before melting back into the wilderness to escape retaliation. With attacks growing more frequent the entirety of the east may soon plunge into chaos."
  dvg_plantagenia.36.a: "Catastrophe!"

  dvg_plantagenia.37.t: "The Death of Saint Georges"
  dvg_plantagenia.37.d: "Upon hearing the news of Sir Saint-Georges' Death, thousands have gathered in Toulouse to pay their respects."

  dvg_plantagenia.38.d: "As we prepare to march to war for the liberation of our people questions have arisen regarding the composition of the new Libérien officer corps. "
  dvg_plantagenia.38.f: "Given the significant role of mulatto support in securing Libérie our leader among them many of them had expected to be placed in commanding roles. While it is unquestionable that they have more military experience than freed slaves adopting such an overt preferential policy will rankle the sentiments of black men and has troubling implications given the egalitarian spirit in Libérien society."

  dvg_plantagenia.39.d: "With [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]'s ascent to power,the country is still divided on his rule. "
  dvg_plantagenia.39.f: "Sir [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] and his colleagues are not perfect despite their supporters’ pretensions. This is a known fact in the abstract but its consequences are causing political division amongst Libériens. His attempt to balance aristocratic tendencies with republican zeal and his forceful determined manner has brought criticism. The actual complaints vary – that he and his leading men are hypocrites autocrats or too focused on war to attend to the needs of freedmen – but the critiques of our leader are escalating and growing more complex. There is a fear that allowing such sentiments to remain in the public sphere will sabotage the revolution and embolden its internal enemies."

  dvg_plantagenia.40.t: "A New Day for Libérie"
  dvg_plantagenia.40.d: "As our new nation settles in, our leader gets many visitors."
  dvg_plantagenia.40.f: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has so little time these days. With the war over he has thrown himself into the work of organizing the new nation. In a given day he receives visitors from across Libérie : politicians, entrepenaurs, journalists, and the list goes on. He often speaks on behalf of the dizzying number of new civil societies and is in high demand to be given tours and inspections of all sorts of military and civilian facilities. Add to that the burden of bureaucracy and wrangling the emerging Liberian political system not just the legislature but his own party and it’s a miracle that Saint-Georges finds any time to sleep. After a long day of campaigning for his party in Alibamon he had returned home and was heading to dinner when his second-in-command General Rochambeau approached him. He reached into his jacketand produced…"

  dvg_plantagenia.41.d: "The martyrdom of President Saint-Georges has produced a public outcry with people of all colors – white, black, and mulatto  – rallying in support of their deceased leader."
  dvg_plantagenia.41.f: "Tens of thousands attended his funeral in Fort Toulouse with Saint-Georges first lying in state before being transported to and buried in his hometown of Mobile. The assassin General de Rochambeau will soon stand trial for murder. He claims that he was compelled to act by an aristocratic conspiracy but the evidence of his claims is slim. As reporters from around the world travel to Libérie to cover the funeral and the trial they are struck by the ways in which Libérie is emerging as a cohesive, democratic black-ruled nation. Rather than tear the nation apart the beloved Saint-Georges’ martyrdom has instead brought the nation together in mourning the greatest visionary of their age. It appears that Libérien democracy has passed its final test and has received its father’s inheritance : liberty, equality, and fraternity."
  dvg_plantagenia.41.a: "Au revoir père. Nous vous rendrons fier"

 
  dvg_plantagenia.42.t: "The Georgian Empire"
  dvg_plantagenia.42.d: "The mulatto aristocrats have announced that Saint-Georges was assassinated by Jean-Paul Blanchet the son of a former Planteur. The slaying of Saint-Georges has agonized Libérie."
  dvg_plantagenia.42.f: "We were naïve in believing that democracy and republicanism would protect us from Libérie’s myriad foreign and domestic enemies. Therefore it has been decided by the upper echelons of the political and military elite that a more robust and resilient system of government is necessary. General Rochambeau has been coronated Emperor George I of the Georgian Empire both named in the former President’s memory and has created many wealthy or influential mulattos as new peers of the realm.
