#  je_venice_and_greece:0 "A Crisis Brewing in Greece"
#  je_venice_and_greece_reason:0 "The Venetian intervention in favor of the Greek Rebellion against the Ottoman Empire during the Ottoman Civil War was crucial in ending Ottoman rule over the Balkans. However, while the support of Venice was crucial in saving the fledging rebellion, the subsequent annexation of Greece by Venice has deeply outraged Greek nationalists and caused unrest throughout mainland Greece. The status quo cannot hold and the promise of Doge Silvestro Dandolo to re-evaluate Greece's relationship with Venice after the war's completion is quickly coming due." 

je_ven_patricians_success:0 "Patrician Entrenchment"
je_ven_patricians_success_reason:0 "In a defining moment of upheaval, radical factions within the Venetian Republic have risen up against the entrenched Patrician elite. Fueled by a combination of nationalist fervor, socio-economic grievances, and a desire for political enfranchisement, the radicals have taken to the streets, demanding an end to the caste-based system and calling for sweeping reforms. This acute moment of revolt marked a significant challenge to the Patricians' grip on power and set the stage for a critical struggle over the future direction of the Venetian Republic. \nThe progress bar will: \n#bold decrease#! by #r 0.1#! per week if you have a radical or reformer in government. \n#bold increase#! by #g 0.1#! per week if you have a Patrician interest group in government. \n#bold increase#! by #g 0.1#! per week if you chose to support positivist reforms and have a positivist in government."

# venice.1.d:0 "The Republic of Venice stands on the crossroads of the Mediterranean. Queen of the Adriatic, Venice's power, wealth, and status have greatly diminished since its heights during the Renaissance. Though still in possession of a vast colonial empire stretching from Cyprus to Athesia, the recent intervention in the Ottoman Civil War and acquisition of the Greek mainland has become an evergrowing headache. Greek nationalists increasingly call for a fully independent Greece, while to the West, nationalistic forces are plotting to unify Italy, once and for all. Yet in the face of these threats, the Patrician nobility continues to resist the winds of change, fearful that any change to the status quo will end their vicelike grip over power. As a Doge, you will have to guide Venice during this perilous century or watch as Venice fades into ever greater irrelevance."

#Now the call for Greek independence can be heard far and wide throughout the Greek possessions, while to the West, nationalistic forces are plotting to unify Italy, once and for all. Yet in the face of these threats, the Patrician nobility continues to resist the winds of change, fearful that any change to the status quo will end their vicelike grip over power. As a Doge, you will have to guide Venice during this perilous century or watch as Venice fades into ever greater irrelevance.
