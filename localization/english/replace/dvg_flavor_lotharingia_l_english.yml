 je_lotharian_house_of_cards: "House of Cards"
 je_lotharian_house_of_cards_reason: "Under the regime established by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] might be a military powerhouse but it sits atop a 'House of Cards' as some might call it, for how fragile it is. Depending on how things go, history might repeat itself or something new can be forged entirely."

 autocracy_enacted_tt: "Autocracy Enacted."
 army_disapproval_tt: "Low Armed Forces Approval" 
 army_approval_tt: "High Armed Forces Approval"
 atlantian_fervor_tt: "Cultural Fervor for Atlantian culture is greater than or equal to 50." 
 afro_amerigan_fervor_tt: "Cultural Fervor for Afro Amerigan culture is greater than or equal to 50." 
 guarani_fervor_tt: "Cultural Fervor for Guarani culture is greater than or equal to 50."

 je_reconquering_atlantia: "Reclaiming Cote du Cafe"
 je_reconquering_atlantia_reason: "Cote du Cafe was once our province, but stolen away from us by foreign powers and as a result is no longer under our control. The house that is [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is not complete without it."

 de_aigle_progress_bar: "House Fragility Progress"
 de_aigle_progress_bar_desc: "House of Cards Instability"

 
je_reuniting_lotharingia: "Aigle's Flight"
je_reuniting_lotharingia_reason: "The House of Cards might have collapsed, but surely it can be rebuilt again! This is the chance, for de Aigle to live up to his namesake, and soar above the enemies trying to tear him down!"
collapsed_lotharingia: "The Guarani, Odonia, Atlantia, and Nouvelle Alsace have broken away from us and have yet to be taken back." 

je_odonia_unite: "Liberating Lotharingia Once More"
je_odonia_unite_reason: "Although we once fought alongside De Aigle and his cronies against Burgundy, we did it to be free of oppression and what we got was a betrayal of that. Let's fight for freedom once more like we always have!"

je_guarani_unite: "Retaking Guarani Lands"
je_guarani_unite_reason: "Ever since the Europeans, we have found ourselves under the oppressive rule of their descendants. If we can take and keep our homelands for good, then they will have to recognize our independence."

je_lot_sol: "Raising [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s Standard of Living"
je_lot_sol_reason: "Although the main point of contention is [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName]'s cronyism, civil war progress can be delayed if the standard of living can be raised."
 
je_nouvelle_alsace: "Back to Burgundy"
je_nouvelle_alsace_reason: "During the Lotharian War of Independence, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was a loyalist stronghold. When Denis de Aigle was allegedly elected president only to later rule as a tyrant, we never had a proper say in that either. Perhaps our interests are best protected if whoever rules Lotharingia is deterred from annexing us for good. Instead of being caught up in local squabbles, we have more to gain from being part of a greater global enterprise instead."

je_anglo_lotharingia: "The Anglo-Lotharian Union"
je_anglo_lotharingia_reason: "Although Lotharingia and Beornia have a shared history with the close ties of the Aigle and Cavendish families, the warm sentiment is not shared by everyone in the country. Especially to some of those who fought for Lotharingia's independence, this union goes against their values. "

 
je_lotharian_awakening: "The Great Awakening in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
je_lotharian_awakening_reason: "Across the continent, as a new influx of migrants from Europe has coincided with changes in political leadership and standard of living, many people in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] are joining new churches and religious movements. Only time will tell if this will result in any meaningful political changes."

je_grand_chaco: "Grand Chaco Dispute"
je_grand_chaco_reason: "The Grand Chaco is a disputed region in the heart of Ameriga. Anyone who can take control of the whole region is likely to become more popular."



fragile_blt: "The Anglo-Lotharian Empire has stamped out its monarchy. "

 #Events
 
dvg_lotharingia.10.t: "The Return of the Golden Province"
dvg_lotharingia.10.d: "Thanks to our might, we have managed to retake Cote du Cafe."
dvg_lotharingia.10.f: "A land rich in gold mines and coffee plantations, imagine all the wealth it can bring us! It seems like nothing beats the power of threats and violence if you don't get your way, we would know very well of course."
dvg_lotharingia.10.a: "Another card for our house!"

dvg_lotharingia.1.t: "The Republic of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
dvg_lotharingia.1.d: "After fighting not only for its independence, but also for the civil war that ensued right after it, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] now finds itself under the grip of the controversial war hero [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], along with his inner circle."
dvg_lotharingia.1.f: "Although [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] claims to be a republic by having [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] be elected as a non-monarch, there are still those who see this as a mere facade. The Nouvellsatians in the northeast who fought on the side of Burgundy during independence certainly did not support him, nor did the Guarani in the northwest who did not even get much of a chance to vote in the first place. Although the current ruling class can owe its position thanks to the Beornians and Odonians in the southwest, it should be noted the Odonians for the most part mainly supported [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] mainly as just part of the anti-Burgundian effort. The Odonians in particular were conflicted about our current leader, but his victory in the civil war along with the appointment of the right people has resolved and put aside any such conflict for now."
dvg_lotharingia.1.a: "Vive la Republique!"

dvg_lotharingia.2.t: "A New Lotharingia?"
dvg_lotharingia.2.d: "After consolidating power for the nation's lifespan, Denis de Aigle with his family and friends have been able to enjoy a comfortable rule over the country for half a century."
dvg_lotharingia.2.f: "Without much significant opposition yet upon the country's 50th anniversary and with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName]'s health detiriorating, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is at a crossroads. Odds are if he dies, another [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] can take his place. We've only embraced being a republic in name so maybe we can double down on the nepotism instead? Obviously, there might be political enemies lying in wait for the chance to finally strike, but they should not be an issue as we have survived this long. \n\n Of course, maybe we could just appoint somebody else qualified to take the reins or pivot towards the liberal ideas a republic can embody?"

dvg_lotharingia.2.f1: "Over the years, the political actions of de Aigle have varied but for one thing : the independence and unity of Lotharingia. All his actions have always been in the interest of the new nation that was born out of the oppression of Burgundy. But as Atlantian interests take over a large part of the national economy and their Liberal views create instability the 'chef' wonders. His Presidency-for-life of the Republic only arose because of the Civil War against the traitors that wanted to tie Lotharingia with Europe once again : they had used democracy to weaken the country after all. In his discussions with Edward of Beornia he nonetheless expressed that ruling would be easier as King and the idea of royalty has often been used both to support his actions or tarnish his reputation. But at the same time with Lotharingia reunified with Atlantia and proved strong and resilient perhaps it is time to let democracy flourish once again in the country and bring back the ideals of the Lotharian Founding Fathers?"

dvg_lotharingia.2.a: "A monarchy fits the national character! [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] forever!"
dvg_lotharingia.2.b: "We're a republic, not a democracy!"
dvg_lotharingia.2.c: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] is truly the leader of all time, and has been for years. Why change it?"
dvg_lotharingia.2.e: "We'll not be just a republic, but also a democracy!"

dvg_lotharingia.3.t: "Benevolent Dictatorship?"
dvg_lotharingia.3.d: "Although many have decried [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]'s autocratic rule, others are saying it might not be such a bad thing after all. Some are even considering making him into a monarch."
dvg_lotharingia.3.f: "In what appears to be an unstable continent"
dvg_lotharingia.3.a: "We fought for independence against a monarchy. Let's not become one."
dvg_lotharingia.3.b: "The time has come to establish cement a new dynasty that is Amerigan."

dvg_lotharingia.4.t: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] for Liberty"
dvg_lotharingia.4.d: "Through a series of effective reforms and purges, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was able to free itself the shackles of tyranny and corruption."
dvg_lotharingia.4.f: "After voluntarily relinquishing the power over time and seeing the country yearn for liberty, Chef [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] realized the writing was on the wall and that it was better to respect the will of the people. To embrace the country's liberalization and also appeal to the Burgundiphiles and conservatives in the country, he appoints the Burgundian  Jean Bouillon to oversee the transition. As for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] himself, he has retired to the Beornian countryside where he makes poetry and harvests crops, away from Lotharian politics for good. Now, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can become a beacon of liberty, for Ameriga and the world! "
dvg_lotharingia.4.a: "Vive les Lothariens!!"

dvg_lotharingia.5.t: "The Cards Fall Apart"
dvg_lotharingia.5.d: "As discontent with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName]'s autocratic rule has grown, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has found itself in yet another civil war. The Nouvellsatians, Atlantians, and Guarani demand independence while Odonian interest groups are staging a coup to unite the country under a different regime." 
dvg_lotharingia.5.f: " 'Traitors! Traitors everywhere!' proclaims the state propaganda. The 'House of Cards' holding [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] together has shattered. The nation once known for being governed by an iron fist has now collapsed into a bunch of states vying to set aside the grip of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName]'s regime. Although it seems the majority of the country has split off from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName]'s ambitions, there are still some in Fort Lothere who support him.\n \n 'I was born a Lotharian and I will die a Lotharian!' proclaims one soldier. For many of these men, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] is the only ruler they have ever known and may very well be the only one they ever will. For [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName], a life of war and politics is all he has ever known. To him, the unfolding situation is all too familiar.\n \n For the rest of the country however, these are the very reasons they seek a different future."

dvg_lotharingia.5.a: "Let us repeat history! [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] forever!"   
dvg_lotharingia.5.ab: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ODO').GetName] will bring liberty to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]!"
dvg_lotharingia.5.b: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_NEA').GetName] is not [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]!"
dvg_lotharingia.5.c: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ATL').GetName] shall be free!"
dvg_lotharingia.5.aa: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_TGI').GetName] will bring back Guarani sovereignty!"

dvg_lotharingia.6.t: "House Rebuilt"
dvg_lotharingia.6.d: "Despite the ambitious efforts of traitors and secessionists, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]'s regime was able to reunite the country."
dvg_lotharingia.6.f: "It is often said those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it. However, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] knows his country's history very well, and made sure it was repeated. 'I am Lotharingia' he tells himself as he looks in the mirror. What were these people thinking? That fate would turn out differently? Winning civil wars with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] is Lotharingia's destiny!\n\n As order is being restored throughout the country, what was once a fragile 'House of Cards' is now something much stronger. With [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s future now reaffirmed, what should this new house and its leader of all time be addressed?"

dvg_lotharingia.6.a: "We are a House of Steel! Vive le Chef!"
dvg_lotharingia.6.b: "We are the House of Eagle! Vive le Roi! "

dvg_lotharingia.7.t: "Goodbye General"
dvg_lotharingia.7.d: "Through a series of reforms and purges, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was able to free itself from the shackles of corruption and peacefully give up its ambitions to reunite the country."
dvg_lotharingia.7.f: "Realizing how futile it would be to reclaim his country's lost territories, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has realized that it was better to respect the will of the people and simply give up. He and his cronies have retired peacefully out of the public eye. What is left of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can now become a beacon of liberty, for Ameriga and the world!"
dvg_lotharingia.7.a: "Vive la Liberte!"


dvg_lotharingia.8.t: "Enfin, Il Tombe!"
dvg_lotharingia.8.d: "Despite the odds, we were able to occupy and defeat the remnants of Aigle's forces as our troops enter Fort Lothere. The regime put in place by Denis de Aigle is no more."
dvg_lotharingia.8.f: "As his palace was being sieged, the ousted ex-dictator managed to slip behind our ranks and attempted to flee to Beornia. As he was about to disembark from Charlemagne however, a homeless war veteran by the name of 'Charles de Kinsen' recognized the former comrade-in-arms and shot him to death yelling 'I am Lotharingia!'. Upon hearing this news, people all over the country are cheering knowing that this long-ruling despot's rule on the country is now over. Truly one of the assassinations of all time."
dvg_lotharingia.8.a: "Long Live Liberty!"

dvg_lotharingia.9.t: "A United Guarani Nation!"
dvg_lotharingia.9.d: "After being ruled over and discriminated against by the Euro-Amerigans for centuries, we have been able to secure our sovereignty in spite of their efforts to defeat us."
dvg_lotharingia.9.f: "Indigenous people from all over the continent are celebrating our victory."
dvg_lotharingia.9.a: "Vive [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]!"

dvg_lotharingia.11.t: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] "
dvg_lotharingia.11.d: "The time has come to discuss the question of our destiny."
dvg_lotharingia.11.f: "For some, this fight was that of democracy vs autocracy. For others, it was the fight of the civilized against the savages. \n \n However, there of course remains the option of assuming the mantle of being the True Lotharingia."
dvg_lotharingia.11.a: "We are a Western, democratic country!"
dvg_lotharingia.11.b: "Let's double down on our heritage."
dvg_lotharingia.11.c: "Lotharingia shall know true freedom someday!"

dvg_lotharingia.12.t: "The King and The Chef"
dvg_lotharingia.12.d: "In the middle of Fort Lothere's city centre, a new statue of King [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BEO').GetRuler.GetFirstName] has been built adjacent to the already existing monument to Chef [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]."
dvg_lotharingia.12.f: "To [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BEO').GetName] and to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName], this is a great symbol of unity and friendship, especially given their shared history in the war for independence. If anything, some would say it added character to what otherwise was an empty patch of concrete as now there was something new to see from across the Grande Rivière. However, to the more radical elements of the populace, this was yet another reminder of who their oppressors were..."
dvg_lotharingia.12.a: "Who cares what a bunch of radicals think? We are just showing strength in unity!"

dvg_lotharingia.13.t: "Dethroning Despots"
dvg_lotharingia.13.d: "As [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has become more democratic and with De Aigle ousted, a question has arisen on what should be done with the Statues of de Aigle and King Edward."
dvg_lotharingia.13.f: "For a long time, the statues of a dictator and the king who helped install him to power were looming symbols of tyranny over a populace that once fought hard for democracy. Now, as we move away from the era of kings and dictators, many are calling for the removal of these statues."
dvg_lotharingia.13.a: "Yes, let's tear them down! Oppression should not be glorified in any circumstance."
dvg_lotharingia.13.b: "No, these are important symbols of our country's history and should stay as is."
dvg_lotharingia.13.c: "Let's relocate them to a museum as a compromise."

dvg_lotharingia.14.t: "An end to the Anglo-Lotharian Union?"
dvg_lotharingia.14.d: "Despite the shared history of Beornia and Lotharingia, many in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] do not approve of the union, especially in the Lotharian part of the realm."
dvg_lotharingia.14.f: "To them, this was a complete betrayal of everything they fought for in the war of independence against Burgundy."
dvg_lotharingia.14.a: "The  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] WILL stay united!"
dvg_lotharingia.14.b: "Well, every cursed marriage leads to a divorce..."

dvg_lotharingia.15.t: "De Aigle Criticized"
dvg_lotharingia.15.d: "A few years ago criticism of Chef [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] would’ve been unthinkable. With his vast network of agents strewn throughout the country nobody would’ve dared say anything seriously damaging about him not to anyone except those that they absolutely trusted. Yet recently a strange mood has come over [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] : that of dissent."
dvg_lotharingia.15.f: "In meeting houses and in tavern in marketplaces and in alleyways [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] and his government have begun to be questioned with unprecedented intensity. More and more people are beginning to take issue with his rule : with his suppression of democracy with his management of the economy with his control of the media with his ban on public meetings…The list goes on a litany of complaints against his dictatorship and though our brave police try to squash what they can the whispers keep coming."
dvg_lotharingia.15.a: "Be silent! I command it!"

dvg_lotharingia.16.t: "A Plan for Peace in Lotharingia"
dvg_lotharingia.16.d: "It appears that Chef de Aigle’s grip on [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName] is finally beginning to weaken. Criticism of his rule has begun to grow to unprecedented levels as our agents within the country have reported."
dvg_lotharingia.16.f: "This is an excellent opportunity to fuel such discontent and fan the flames of popular anger towards him until his regime finally collapses. After that it would only be the humane thing to do to protect whatever emerged from the destruction of the dictatorship. The simplest method of doing this would be to help discontented areas of [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName] push for greater autonomy – the more autonomy the better. Let us convene a meeting in Varennes to broach the issue."
dvg_lotharingia.16.a: "This is for the greater good."

dvg_lotharingia.17.t: "The Varennes Convention"
dvg_lotharingia.17.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] was merely concerned when he heard that more and more people were beginning to repudiate the regime. When he heard that the governors of Nouvelle Alsace and Odonia had begun to speak out against him he grew furious. Yet both governors maintain control of a local militia for internal peacekeeping and lately they seem to have received outside help in outfitting it to be more akin to a true army."
dvg_lotharingia.17.f: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ATL').GetAdjective] have stepped into the picture offering to hold a conference in Varennes to discuss a diplomatic solution. What they proposed to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName however shocked him : the full autonomy of New Alsace and Odonia with the Chef allowed to dictate their foreign policy but with their respective governors in full control of their domestic policies. Both men seem to be recent converts to Atlantian liberalism yet this could relieve the burden on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName]’s government and allow them to focus more on suppressing dissent."
dvg_lotharingia.17.a: "Very well, anything for peace."
dvg_lotharingia.17.b: "Ridiculous! I still have my pride!"

dvg_lotharingia.18.t: "The Varennes Protocol"
dvg_lotharingia.18.d: "Though the Chef was bitter about the decision he finally decided to relent and accept our proposal for the federalization of [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName]."
dvg_lotharingia.18.f: "While this will probably allow him to more efficiently crack down on liberalism within his remaining directly-ruled lands New Alsace and Odonia both seem set to become islands of liberty."
dvg_lotharingia.18.a: "A blow to his regime nonetheless."

dvg_lotharingia.19.t: "Failure of the Varennes Convention"
dvg_lotharingia.19.d: "The Chef was hostile to us from the moment that he heard that Atlantia sought to get involved in [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetAdjective] affairs. When he heard our proposal for federalization he grew utterly outraged."
dvg_lotharingia.19.f: "Denouncing us as “loathesome butchers” and “a gang of unwashed thieves” he quickly departed from Varennes hurling invectives as he left. It seems that [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetAdjective] federalization is dead in the water."
dvg_lotharingia.19.a: "Was it something we said?" 

dvg_lotharingia.20.t: "The Rise of D'Anton"
dvg_lotharingia.20.d: "A rising star in the military corps, the young general Louis Antoine d'Anton, son-in-law of former chef De Aigle, has been appointed Minister of War of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. He promotes a policy of strong aggression against national threats and continental unification."
dvg_lotharingia.20.f: "Proclaiming himself an 'Euro-Amerigan Nationalist', D'Anton sees Lotharingia as the divinely-ordained master of Ameriga, and himself as the scion which will bring about this golden age. His reforms entail a heavy-handed militarization program, and he is deeply shaped by his experiences in conflict against the Inca Empire, who he considers the biggest threat to Amerigan stability."
dvg_lotharingia.20.a: "He seems to be gaining more power by the day..."

dvg_lotharingia.21.t: "The Question of Beornia"
dvg_lotharingia.21.d: "With the existence of the Beornia now in the pages of history, the question has arisen on how the Anglophone populace of the southern plains shall be integrated."
dvg_lotharingia.21.f: "    "
dvg_lotharingia.21.a: "Beornians and Lotharians are equals to rule a country side by side." 
dvg_lotharingia.21.b: "Beornia has always been Lotharian land and shall always be." 

dvg_lotharingia.22.t: "A Man of God"
dvg_lotharingia.22.d: "By winning over the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('devout_ig').GetName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has managed ride the wave that was the Great Awakening. "
dvg_lotharingia.22.f: " Many legislative members of the country have moved to sign 'God Bless [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]!' as the country's official motto and to include Biblical references in the anthem. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has been seen holding a monthly prayer breakfast."
dvg_lotharingia.22.a: "God in Heaven,  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] on Earth." 


dvg_lotharingia.23.t: "The Triumph of Secularism"
dvg_lotharingia.23.d: "The so-called Great Awakening of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] turned out to be of little consequence as the fervor for a state church died out."
dvg_lotharingia.23.f: "  Realizing that they would prefer to keep their individual liberties and live their lives more freely, the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have even stopped attending religious services en masse, preferring to spend time on other community gatherings or individual pursuits."
dvg_lotharingia.23.a: "Let's keep God as a private matter." 
dvg_lotharingia.23.b: "God shouldn't even be a matter at all." 

dvg_lotharingia.24.t: "The Great Awakening arrives in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
dvg_lotharingia.24.d: "A phenomenon known as the 'the Great Awakening' has emerged in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] after  "
dvg_lotharingia.24.f: "  Realizing that they would prefer to keep their individual liberties and live their lives more freely, the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have even stopped attending religious services en masse, preferring to spend time on other community gatherings or individual pursuits."
dvg_lotharingia.24.a: "God Bless [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]?" 


dvg_lotharingia.25.t: "Anglicans Seek Special Treatment"
dvg_lotharingia.25.d: "The Anglican Church of Beornia are seeking privileges in our country. "
dvg_lotharingia.25.f: " A man with a funny accent has approached the legislature today, asking the Anglicans from Beornia be granted special priveleges - such as tax credits, government support in building schools and hospitals, along with being given permits to preach in public squares. Of course, now other Protestant denominations are seeking the same privileges too."
dvg_lotharingia.25.a: "No we won't allow this foreign nonsense in our country." 
dvg_lotharingia.25.b: "We are all children of God and as such you will all get such treatment." 

dvg_lotharingia.26.t: "Missions in Paraguay"
dvg_lotharingia.26.d: "As the Chaco region has essentially become 'the Wild West' of  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], missions there have been developing. "
dvg_lotharingia.26.f: " A man with a funny accent has approached the legislature today, asking the Anglicans from Beornia be granted special priveleges - such as tax credits, government support in building schools and hospitals, along with being given permits to preach in public squares. Of course, now other Protestant denominations are seeking the same privileges too."
dvg_lotharingia.26.a: "Ban these missionary efforts."
dvg_lotharingia.26.b: "Ignore these missionary efforts."
dvg_lotharingia.26.c: "Encourage these missionary efforts." 

dvg_lotharingia.27.t: "Equinoxea asks for Aid"
dvg_lotharingia.27.d: "In their ongoing fight against Amazonie, the Equinoxien rebels have asked for Lotharingia's assistance."
dvg_lotharingia.27.f: "Realizing that they would prefer to keep their individual liberties and live their lives more freely, the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have even stopped attending religious services en masse, preferring to spend time on other community gatherings or individual pursuits."
dvg_lotharingia.27.a: "Lotharingia will not give any aid to such an uncivilized group of people in any capacity." 
dvg_lotharingia.27.b: "Lotharingia shall not officially provide aid, but will discreetly give the necessary supplies." 
dvg_lotharingia.27.c: "Lotharingia commits itself to liberty against the Amazonien tyrants!" 

dvg_lotharingia.28.t: "Land Claim Disputes"
dvg_lotharingia.28.d: "As more White settlers seek land in our country, there is increase conflict between them and the indigenous population. Often, there has been overlapping land claims."
dvg_lotharingia.28.f: "When Lotharingia fought against Burgundy, arbitrary laws prevented any sanctioned settlement in the west of the country to prevent conflict with the indigenous peoples. Now that Lotharigia has become independent, more opportunities have arisen - for dubious contracts and empty land theories. Some Guarani and their allied missionaries have petitioned us to create a special state for them to protect their heritage and homelands in spite of these settlers - while still remaining under our sovereignty of course."
dvg_lotharingia.28.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]  fought for self-determination - of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] to make better use of the land." 
dvg_lotharingia.28.b: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] fought for self-determination - and that includes protecting the rights of Guarani on their own land." 

dvg_lotharingia.29.t: "Choosing a National Language"
dvg_lotharingia.29.d: "Now that Beornia and Lotharingia has united, the primary language of the country has been up for debate."

dvg_lotharingia.30.a: "We will use Lotharian/French."

Like Lotharingia fought for liberty from Burgundy, Nouvelle Alsace shall fight for freedom from the failed experiment that is Lotharingia.'  "
dvg_lotharingia.32.a: "Bigotry is another form of oppression that shall be stamped out." 
dvg_lotharingia.32.b: "The time has come to protect Western civilization from exploitative liberalism!"

dvg_lotharingia.33.f: " 'When I came to Lotharingia from Europe, it was so that I could live peacefully and safely with my family as did other White Lotharians. Now we have to deal with a government that favors the uncivilized savage over their own kind?

dvg_lotharingia.34.f: "  '[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] prides itself on being a country of liberty and prosperity, but to the expense of whom? On the backs of whom? From the labor of whom?

Already, some of the White and Black Lotharian settlers are said to be fleeing from this new Guarani national territory." 
dvg_lotharingia.35.a: "Lotharingia has and always been a settler country - survival of the fittest. Viva Lotharingia!"

dvg_lotharingia.36.a: "The Golden Province has been and always will be Lotharian!"
dvg_lotharingia.36.b: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ATL').GetName] will light the fuse of liberty in Ameriga!"
