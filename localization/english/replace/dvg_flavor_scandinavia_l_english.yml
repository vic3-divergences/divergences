 #Primer
 dvg_scandinavia.1.t: "The Kingdom of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_scandinavia.1.d: "The United Kingdom of Scandinavia and Scotland, heir to the Kalmar Union, extends from Scotland to Novgorod, from the Arctic Circle to northern Germany."
 dvg_scandinavia.1.f: "Following the conclusion of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], although making great territorial gains, finds itself in a delicate position. Unrest and separatist nationalism are on the rise from the Highlands of Scotland to the marshes of Finland, fueled by economic decline since the 18th century. King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] the III, who ascended the throne after the end of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], has called the Scandinavian Parliament into session for the first time in years after the absolutist policies of his father. Yet his methods remain authoritarian, [concept_dvg_fish]. A great storm is brewing in Scandinavia, and whether the United Kingdom will manage to weather it remains to be seen"
 dvg_scandinavia.1.a: "Til Skandinaven!"
 
 ###JOURNAL ENTRIES###
 je_sca_chaos_under_four_crowns: "Chaos Under Four Crowns"
 je_sca_chaos_under_four_crowns_reason: "Scandinavia is a nation of many people, whilst Scandinavians and [concept_dod_sca_cufc_scots] make up the majority of the population, vast tracts of our empire do not see themselves as Scandinavian!\n\nThe [concept_dod_sca_cufc_finns] in the east are the most unruly, with the [concept_dod_sca_cufc_karelians] even further East, still loyal to the crown. The [concept_dod_sca_cufc_germans] sit complacent to our south, under the watchful eye of our military garrison in the region. Finally the backwater Baltic region populated by the [concept_dod_sca_cufc_balts], a sluggish region relegated as a buffer to protect our Baltic Lake!\n\n #red #bold Without our careful management, we could see our empire torn apart from within!"
 je_sca_cufc_finland: "Finnish Tensions"
 je_sca_cufc_finland_reason: "The Finns have long protected their unique language and heritage, despite being under the Scandinavian nation for centuries, they have been the most unruly. Whilst there has been some success in assimilating them - with some significant cities speaking Scandinavian, and the [concept_dod_sca_finland_landreform] entrentching landowners under the Crown of Sweden as the main landholders of Finland - for the most part, the Finns remain opposed to Scandinavia and largely unintegrated."
 je_sca_cufc_baltic: "Baltic Tensions"
 je_sca_cufc_baltic_reason: "The Balts - Estonians and Latvians - are a comparatively minor part of our nation, being a smaller, generally more rural population at the strategic edge of our nation. Thier position provides us a buffer against the anarchy that is Russia and the slow Polish state, as well as ensuring our position as Hegemon of the Baltic Sea. Though the region is a backwater, with an unclear governing system devised from Livonian, German, Baltic and Scandinavian traditions, it is in dire need of reform."
 je_sca_cufc_germany: "German Tensions"
 je_sca_cufc_germany_reason: "The Germans are the most recent addition to our Empire, however have quickly been integrated, their industrious ethic and Protestant traditions seen as valuable and akin to Scandinavian culture. However it is unlikely that they will remain complacent for long, Germany is a tumultous place and any significant German state would likely see our possessions are a German homeland. Additionally, the German population is the one of the largest minorities in Scandinavia, any uprising would be devastating for us!"
 je_sca_kings_watch: "Anger of the Crown"
 je_sca_kings_watch_reason: "The monarchy and nobility have kept a close eye on the parliaments following the 1820 reforms, whilst they hold less power over the country, they still remain strong. Whilst we may want what's best for our people, the nobility are our people too, the most powerful of our people... \n\n#bold #red We must tread carefully! Pushing the nobility and monarchy too much may see a return to pre-1820 rule!"
 je_sca_cufc_karelia: "The Karelian March"
 je_sca_cufc_karelia_reason: "The Karelians have a more priveleged position within Scandinavia, those in the region of Karelia live under the [concept_dvg_sca_karelian_march], enjoying a degree of autonomy in return for their service in the Scandinavian army. Whilst the arrangement has been comfortable for both the Scandinavian government and Karelian leadership in the March, there's no guarantee that they will sit idly by as other groups within our nation begin to stir..."
