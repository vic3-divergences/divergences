 dvg_scandinavia.1.t: "The Kingdom of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_scandinavia.1.d: "The United Kingdom of Scandinavia and Scotland, heir to the Kalmar Union, extends from Scotland to Novgorod, from the Arctic Circle to northern Germany."
 dvg_scandinavia.1.f: "Following the conclusion of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], although making great territorial gains, finds itself in a delicate position. Unrest and separatist nationalism are on the rise from the Highlands of Scotland to the marshes of Finland, fueled by economic decline since the 18th century. King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] the III, who ascended the throne after the end of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], has called the Scandinavian Parliament into session for the first time in years after the absolutist policies of his father. Yet his methods remain authoritarian, [concept_dvg_fish]. A great storm is brewing in Scandinavia, and whether the United Kingdom will manage to weather it remains to be seen"
 dvg_scandinavia.1.a: "Til Skandinaven!"

 je_sca_chaos_under_four_crowns: "Chaos Under Four Crowns"
 je_sca_chaos_under_four_crowns_reason: "Scandinavia is a nation of many people, whilst Scandinavians make up the plurality of the population, vast tracts of our empire do not see themselves as Scandinavian! They must be dealt with, lest we see the powers at odds with us stoke the flames of their nationalism...\n\nThe Finns have long protected their unique language and heritage, despite being under the Scandinavian nation for centuries, they have been the most unruly. Whilst there has been some success in assimilating them - with some significant cities speaking Scandinavian, and the Landowner Reform of 1767 entrentching landowners under the Crown of Sweden as the main landholders of Finland - for the most part, the Finns remain opposed to Scandinavia.\n\nThe Germans are the most recent addition to our Empire, however have quickly been integrated, their industrious ethic and Protestant traditions seen as valuable and akin to Scandinavian culture. However it is unlikely that they will remain complacent for long, Germany is a tumultous place and any significant German state would likely see our possessions are a German homeland.\n\nThe Balts are a comparatively minor part of our nation, being a smaller, generally more rural population at the strategic edge of our nation. Thier position provides us a buffer against the anarchy that is Russia and the slow Polish state, as well as ensuring our position as Hegemon of the Baltic Sea. Though the region is a backwater, with an unclear governing system devised from Livonian, German, Baltic and Scandinavian traditions, it is in need of reform.\n\n Finally there are the other minorities, who are laregely content/accepted within Scandinavia. The Karelians enjoy a priveledged position in the March, their militarised background and loyal service sees them as an exception in Scandinavia. The Scots are an integral part of Scandinavia, whilst some argue that there should greater seperation, the Scots are largely seen as Scandinavian too, despite linguistic differences and a distinct culture. However we should continue to please these minorities, it would be unwise to turn them against us!"
