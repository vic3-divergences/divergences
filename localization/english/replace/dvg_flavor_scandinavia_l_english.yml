 dvg_scandinavia.1.t: "The Kingdom of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_scandinavia.1.d: "The United Kingdom of Scandinavia and Scotland, heir to the Kalmar Union, extends from Scotland to Novgorod, from the Arctic Circle to northern Germany."
 dvg_scandinavia.1.f: "Following the conclusion of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], although making great territorial gains, finds itself in a delicate position. Unrest and separatist nationalism are on the rise from the Highlands of Scotland to the marshes of Finland, fueled by economic decline since the 18th century. King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] the III, who ascended the throne after the end of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], has called the Scandinavian Parliament into session for the first time in years after the absolutist policies of his father. Yet his methods remain authoritarian, [concept_dvg_fish]. A great storm is brewing in Scandinavia, and whether the United Kingdom will manage to weather it remains to be seen"
 dvg_scandinavia.1.a: "Til Skandinaven!"
 
 ###JOURNAL ENTRIES###
 je_sca_chaos_under_four_crowns: "Chaos Under Four Crowns"
 je_sca_chaos_under_four_crowns_reason: "Scandinavia is a nation of many people, whilst Scandinavians make up the plurality of the population, vast tracts of our empire do not see themselves as Scandinavian!\n\nThe [concept_dod_sca_cufc_finns] in the east are the most unruly, with the [concept_dod_sca_cufc_karelians] even further East, still loyal to the crown. The [concept_dod_sca_cufc_germans] sit complacent to our south, yet they are the largest group behind the Scandinavians and the [concept_dod_sca_cufc_scots]. Finally the backwater Baltic region populated by the [concept_dod_sca_cufc_balts], a sluggish region relegated as a buffer to protect our Baltic Lake!\n\n #red #bold Without our careful management, we could see our empire torn apart from within!"
 je_sca_kings_watch: "Anger of the Crown"
 je_sca_kings_watch_reason: "The monarchy and nobility have kept a close eye on the parliaments following the 1820 reforms, whilst they hold less power over the country, they still remain strong. Whilst we may want what's best for our people, the nobility are our people too, the most powerful of our people... \n\n#bold #red We must tread carefully! Pushing the nobility and monarchy too much may see a return to pre-1820 rule!"
