 je_blackbirding_reason: "Ever since its founding, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has had a shortage of laborers and hence through a network of seafarers have been taking indentured servants throughout the Pacific islands that are not of our culture or religion. This trade of laborers frequently relied on coercion, deception, and kidnapping to transport tens of thousands of indigenous people from islands in the Pacific Ocean to adjacent territory. However, as this has caused tension among the powers of the Pacific that have colonized these islands and are seeing the populations of their being drained to the competition."

 #Events
 dvg_oceania.1.t: "Nouvelle Zélande"
 dvg_oceania.1.d: "Our colony in [concept_dod_zhourao] has grown quite significant, and proposals have been put forth to turn the region into an autonomous penal colony."
 dvg_oceania.1.f: "This will aid in our adminstration of the region."
 dvg_oceania.1.a: "A new country in the Eastern Continent."
 dvg_oceania.2.t: "Australia is open for colonization!"
 dvg_oceania.2.d: "This is an event that un-railroads Australia, it is set in the game rules."
 dvg_oceania.2.f: "This makes Australia and Papua colonizable by either all nations or nations with claims on the states using the vanilla colonization mechanics..."
 dvg_oceania.2.a: "Is the bordergore worth it?"
 dvg_oceania.2.b: "I want to use the vanilla colonization, but keeping claims."
 dvg_oceania.3.t: "The Port-Anne Colony"
 dvg_oceania.3.d: "While the port of Carpenterie is the heart of the Burgundian colony of Nouvelle-Zélande, it is controlled in large part by the [concept_dod_voc]. While the company administrators to the north grow rich off the lucrative sandalwood trade, little of that wealth makes its way back to Burgundy. Our government has attempted to circumvent the [concept_dod_voc]'s monopoly by establishing the colonial outpost of Port-Anne to the south, at the headwaters of the Rivière des Cygnes. Using penal labor, mostly Dutch malcontents, we have carved out a permanent presence in [concept_dod_zhourao]."
 dvg_oceania.3.f: "The local Nounegare tribes have proved hostile to further colonization inland, but have slowly warmed to the prospect of trade and proselytisation by our missionaries."
 dvg_oceania.3.a: "Time will tell if Port-Anne will prove a true rival to Carpenterie."
 dvg_oceania.4.t: "The Claiming of the Tanami Desert!"
 dvg_oceania.5.t: "The Expansion of Margere!"
 dvg_oceania.5.d: "While the port of Carpenterie is the heart of the Burgundian colony of Nouvelle-Zélande, it is controlled in large part by the [concept_dod_voc]. While the company administrators to the north grow rich off the lucrative sandalwood trade, little of that wealth makes its way back to Burgundy.

 dvg_oceania.5.f: "The new land has already begun to inspire many settlers to go and seek their fortune!"
 dvg_oceania.5.a: "A good day for our imperial ambitions in [concept_dod_zhourao]."
 dvg_oceania.6.t: "The Claiming of Zhourao's Heartland!"
 dvg_oceania.6.d: ""
 dvg_oceania.6.f: "Thanks to our colonization effort, we have taken control of the heartland of the Zhourao continent, or "Uluru" as we think the locals call it."
 dvg_oceania.6.a: "A step forward for our civilization."
 dvg_oceania.7.t: "The Nouvelle Zélande Colony"
 dvg_oceania.8.t: "Claiming the Yongjia Gulf"
 dvg_oceania.9.t: "Integrating our Recent Conquests"
 dvg_oceania.9.d: "We have merged our conquests into our colony of Nouvelle Zélande!"
 dvg_oceania.9.f: ""...it was the destruction of their traditional society and the dispossession of their lands.""
 dvg_oceania.9.a: "They will serve us better united"
 dvg_oceania.42.t: "Yaluo Opens to our Businesses!"
 dvg_oceania.42.d: "Yaluo has opened their country up to our trade, allowing our businesses full access to their country."
 dvg_oceania.42.f: "A good day for business interests"
 dvg_oceania.42.a: "This will bring us much wealth!"
 dvg_oceania.43.t: "Yaluo Refuses us Access!"
 dvg_oceania.43.d: "Yaluo has decided against allowing our businesses to operate inside their country."
 dvg_oceania.43.f: "A bad day for business interests"
 dvg_oceania.43.a: "Unfortunate"
 dvg_oceania.44.t: "Yaluo Allows us Partial Access!"
 dvg_oceania.44.d: "The news from Yaluo is good, as they have allowed us access in part to their ports. Whilst this is not as good as full access to their country, it will still no doubt aid us."
 dvg_oceania.44.f: "A good day for business interests"
 dvg_oceania.44.a: "This will bring us wealth!"
 dvg_oceania.45.t: "Southern Control Assured!"
 dvg_oceania.45.d: "Now that we have established control over the Southern Island of Ny Sjælland, we can work towards the conquest of the Northern island, and conquer the native [concept_dvg_maoli] that inhibit the area. There is additional a presence of Chinese, located in a port on the Northern tip, under the sway of a [concept_dod_zhourao] polity. Both will have to be eradicated to ensure our dominance over the region."
 dvg_oceania.45.f: "Our biologists are extremely interested in the region, which has already proved to hold a great wealth of biodiversity. Of particular interest are a flightless bird type known to the [concept_dvg_maoli] as the 'Kiwi'."
 dvg_oceania.45.a: "We will ensure the elimination of both parties, and secure the island as a new gem for our crown."
 dvg_oceania.46.t: "The Organization of Ny Sjælland"
 dvg_oceania.46.d: "We have established control over Ny Sjælland's North and South islands, and the Ny Sjælland colony in Australie, with the center of its administration on the island of Vargø, is in a state of rapid development and settlement spurred by the discovery of valuable minerals in the region. The population and economic influx is such that in the future it may no longer require our direct control. Thus we should organize the colony to prepare for the possibility for autonomous rule - only when it is truly ready to exercise such a responsibility, of course."
 dvg_oceania.46.f: ""...it was the destruction of their traditional society and the dispossession of their lands.""
 dvg_oceania.46.a: "We should establish a dominion under our control to better govern the area."
 dvg_oceania.46.a1: "I come from the land down under."
 dvg_oceania.46.b: "There is no need for this."
 dvg_oceania.47.t: "What's in a Name?"
 dvg_oceania.47.d: "Our colony in Vargø is named after a peculiar species of wolf like animal, called Thylacinus Cynocephalus. However, a dispute has recently broken out over the more colloquial, commonplace, naming of the creature. The sides have split into two main camps, those who want to name it the Tylakin, a scandification of the scientific name, and those who want to use the simpler Stribet Pungulv, or striped pouch-wolf, after its distinctive pouch. The two camps have undergone heated debates as of late, and the disputes have at times even come to blows. The debate is threatening to cause chaos in Vargø, and the colonial governor has sent a request for an official decision from Copenhagen."
 dvg_oceania.47.f: "As many as 13 suspects have been arrested in disputes relating to the argument, and more brawls might be on the way should this not be addressed in an official matter."
 dvg_oceania.47.a: "It will be the Tylakin."
 dvg_oceania.47.b: "It will be the Stribet Pungulv"
 dvg_oceania.48.t1: "The Pungulvic Revolt!"
 dvg_oceania.48.t2: "The Tylakinic Revolt!"
 dvg_oceania.48.d1: "The Tylakin situation in Vargø has developed into a full blown revolt. Whilst we thought that our decision on what to call the animal would be an end to the dispute, it appears to have polarized the island against us! Already we are hearing reports of full scale revolt from across the colony, and our colonial governor has been forced to flee abroad. We must act quickly to quell the rebellion, lest it be viewed by other powers as a sign of weakness! The rebels have taken to calling themselves the Pungulvics, after what they believe to be the animals true name."
 dvg_oceania.48.d2: "The Stribet Pungulv situation in Vargø has developed into a full blown revolt. Whilst we thought that our decision on what to call the animal would be an end to the dispute, it appears to have polarized the island against us! Already we are hearing reports of full scale revolt from across the colony, and our colonial governor has been forced to flee abroad. We must act quickly to quell the rebellion, lest it be viewed by other powers as a sign of weakness! The rebels have taken to calling themselves the Tylakinics, after what they believe to be the animals true name."
 dvg_oceania.48.f: "A revolt over a name?"
 dvg_oceania.48.a: "They can't be serious, send in troops!"
 dvg_oceania.48.b: "They can have their independence..."
 dvg_oceania.49.t1: "The Plight of the Tylakin"
 dvg_oceania.49.t2: "The Plight of the Stribet Pungulv"
 dvg_oceania.49.d1: "The Tylakin"
 dvg_oceania.49.d2: "The Stribet Pungulv has become something of a prestige hunt in Vargø, with the animal being seen as exotic and rare. This is rapidly leading to die offs of the animal, and a petition has arrived in Copenhagen from the Vargø scientific society to give the creature protected status due to its signifigance. This would involve making the hunting of the animal punishable, and working to establish reservations for the animals."
 dvg_oceania.49.f: "Historically, the last known Thylacine would die off in 1936, due to the British policy in Tasmania. This, however, was not an inevitability. Should history repeat itself?"
 dvg_oceania.49.a: "Establish official protections for the animal."
 dvg_oceania.49.b: "But their hides look so good on my floor!"
 dvg_oceania.50.t: "The Denpasar Accords on [concept_dod_zhourao]"
 dvg_oceania.50.d: "A Conference was held in Denpasar on the island of Bali today among the Dual Monarchy, Burgundy, and Scandinavia, regarding the status on expansion into the three [concept_dod_zhourao] Polities as an extension of the Treaty of Selon and the Treaty of Paris. None of the European powers were able to push their claim to the [concept_dod_zhourao], and have instead agreed to partition the western continent first, and then look towards the [concept_dod_zhourao] again in twenty two years. Japan too, was invited, but was only subordinated to the terms of the agreement, rather than allowed to participate in the conference."
 dvg_oceania.50.f: "A decisive advantage was not seized by any faction, but the terms of the agreement only last a limited time."
 dvg_oceania.50.a: "This is only a temporary delay, we will set our sights on the West for now, but we will soon hold dominion over the East as well."
 dvg_oceania.50.a1: "The Western powers have slighted us today, but we will ensure that we establish dominion over [concept_dod_zhourao] in the future."
 dvg_oceania.50.b: "We should use this time that has been bought to build up our forces and ensure that we have the strength to resist the Europeans in the future."
 dvg_oceania.52.t: "The Demand"
 dvg_oceania.52.d: "The Anglois, operating out of their islands around what they have come to call Margere, have brought to us a demand. They demand we relinquish control of our gold ports in [concept_dod_zhourao], primary centered around Kayu Jawa. Kayu Jawa has been ours for centuries, since the continent's initial discovery prompted the Ming to grant us the right to mine it to bring tribute to them, and it has brought us much wealth. However, with the loss of most of Makassar to the [concept_dod_voc] and the Scandinavians, we are in no position to attempt to hold anything any longer. We have no choice, it seems, but to bow to their demands. Some, however, amongst the higher circles, have proposed the idea of refusing the demand, better to die fighting, they say, than to die a slow death to the Europeans."
 dvg_oceania.52.f: ""First, they came for the Javans, and I did not speak up because I was not a Javan, then, they came for the Sumatrans, and I did not speak up because I was not a Sumatran. Then, they came for me, and there was no one left to speak up.""
 dvg_oceania.52.a: "We have no choice..."
 dvg_oceania.52.b: "They must be fools if they think we will accept!"
 dvg_oceania.53.t: "Makassar Refuses Us!"
 dvg_oceania.53.d: "A letter has arrived in Paris today. It has been sent to us by the Makassarese Sultan. Its content, is simple. The letter begins by calling our King companion to Satan, and procedes to launch into a horrid torrent of insults."
 dvg_oceania.53.f: ""To the Anglois King, the devil's consort, hellish ruler of a pitiful people, pig farmer and consort, dog layer and vermin keeper, stupid bastard son, whose stench protrudes itself across all lands, enemy of Allah and persecutor of his servants, hope and comfort of the dog and cattle... We will not yield to you, but we will fight you." An excerpt from the Sultan's letter."
 dvg_oceania.53.a: "How... How dare they! We will make for war at once!"
 dvg_oceania.53.b: "Err... We are busy right now. Issue a diplomatic objection, however."
 dvg_oceania.54.t: "Makassar Accepts!"
 dvg_oceania.54.d: "A letter has arrived in Paris today. It has been sent to us by the Makassarese Sultan. Its content, is simple. The letter begins by flattering our King, and ends with the acceptance of our demand for Kayu Jawa. We shall christen the new city as Fort Jersey, and set about annexing it promptly."
 dvg_oceania.54.f: ""To the Anglois King, whose majesty is beyond compare, who Allah has blessed, a heavenly leader of a righteous people... We will of course, be willing to part with the province, as a gift to your excellence." An excerpt from the Sultan's letter."
 dvg_oceania.54.a: "It looks like the Sultan knows his place."
 dvg_oceania.55.t: "The Yolngu Invasion"
 dvg_oceania.55.d: "A group of Yolngu scouts was seen crossing into our border a few days ago, and it seems this was but a prelude to a war to come. They have began another invasion of our lands, and this one, it seems, is final."
 dvg_oceania.55.f: "Allah have mercy on us, for Muslim blood must be shed against brothers."
 dvg_oceania.55.a: "We have prepared for this."
 dvg_oceania.56.t: "The Spreading Chaos"
 dvg_oceania.56.d: "Now that the lands to our East have unified, it seems that war will come to us now. Our inaction in the war, it seems, was folly, and we are now threatened by a much enlarged force from the East."
 dvg_oceania.56.f: "Allah have mercy on us, for Muslim blood must be shed against brothers."
 dvg_oceania.56.a: "We will survive!"
 dvg_oceania.57.t: "The East in Flames"
 dvg_oceania.57.d: "The East is in flames. The Anglois have extended us an offer of 'protection', bringing a large and cohesive treaty for our ruler to sign. Key among the treaty's provisions, is the recognition of the Anglois as our sovereign, and there is no guarantee that the Anglois stick to their side of the treaty. We could, however, simply ordain to face the East alone. Though this will certainly lead to our end too."
 dvg_oceania.57.f: "We have dealt with the Anglois before, and never found such a despicable and unreasonable folk. Their entrance into our region is without doubt a horrifying prospect."
 dvg_oceania.57.a: "From Makassar to the Anglois, the fate of the Wadjiginy is out of our hands."
 dvg_oceania.57.b: "Come what may, we will face the East alone."
 dvg_oceania.58.t: "The Wadjiginy Want Protection"
 dvg_oceania.58.d: "The Wadjiginy Sultanate, South of Fort Jersey in [concept_dod_zhourao] has offered us submission. This is without doubt great for our interests in the area. We can look forward to the further expansion of our influence in the region."
 dvg_oceania.58.f: "Whilst we might at first keep them as a protectorate, there is nothing stopping us from annexing them later. Infact, this will be expected. It seems the Wadjiginy are at the end of their line."
 dvg_oceania.58.a: "Free land? Sign me up!"
 dvg_oceania.58.b: "Bah! Such insolence! Ignore their plea for protection."
 dvg_oceania.501.t: "Our Time Has Come..."
 dvg_oceania.501.d: "The Anglois have demanded we accept several treaties, effectively ending our protectorate status and annexing us directly into their colony."
 dvg_oceania.501.f: ""...it was the destruction of their traditional society and the dispossession of their lands.""
 dvg_oceania.501.a: "Our time has come."
 dvg_oceania.501.b: "We will not stand by and let them do this!"
