je_atlantia_unite: "The New Colossus"
je_atlantia_unite_reason: "Ameriga is often referred to as the "New Colossus because it is a great land  rich in people, culture and resources, welcoming immigrants from all across Europe with freedom and opportunity. The phrase "New Colossus" evokes the image of an Ameriga that has the potential to be a new, mighty, and prestigious force, much like the ancient Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World."

je_ameriga_unite: "Unite All of Ameriga!"
je_ameriga_unite_reason: "Now that we have united the east coast of Ameriga, why not unite the rest of the continent too?"

unite_atlantia_button: "Integrate Amerigan States"
unite_atlantia_button_desc: "Over time, our subjects have acclimated to the concept of a united Amerigan identity. Our liberal ways, support of economic freedom, and opposition to autocracy have all endeared us to our subjects who have come to accept that uniting under our banner might be their best route to liberty. The time has come for greater Amerigan unity with progress!"

atl_invest_button: "Invest in Amerigan States"
atl_invest_button_desc: "The extension of infrastructure in the mid-Atlantic region have been a particularly welcomed addition, a level of development which a Chef's or Planteur's economic narrow-mindedness and apathy towards broad industrialization would never have allowed."

atl_agitate_button: "Promote Insurgency"
atl_agitate_button_desc: "Although Atlantia stands as a beacon of liberty, it is still surrounded by the forces that may seek to undermine it, whether they be dictators or planteurs. It may best serve Atlantia's interests to sow division within their ranks."

varennese_button: "Initiate the Varennes Convention"
varennese_button_desc: "Lotharingia has become unstable for us to make the right push, and set the dominoes to topple de Aigle's regime."


je_atlantia_wild_card: "The Wild Card of Ameriga"
je_atlantia_wild_card_reason: "Although Atlantia is a bastion of liberty in the New World, the same cannot be said for its neighbors. With the right maneuvers, Atlantians can help liberate their neighboring bretheren and potentially unite Ameriga under its promised ideals."

ama_lot_existence_tt: "[SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName] have both collapsed."

dvg_atlantia.10.t: "The Golden Board of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
dvg_atlantia.10.d: "As the circumstances around it change, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] finds itself at a crossroads."
dvg_atlantia.10.f: "Initially a part of Burgundian Lotharingia, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was later seized by Anglois forces and was later ceded to Spanish control as a neutral buffer state. Under Spanish rule, a 'Golden Board' was established due to discovery of gold in the area and the consequential destabilizing impact on the global economy. This board hosts Anglois, Burgundian, and Spanish delegations while excluding Amazoniens and Lotharians. This status quo is unlikely to last forever though, as Atlantia's gold dwindles and Spain finds itself in constant conflict elsewhere. Atlantia's neighbors are also aware of the potential future as well and have even sent members of their populace to help influence local politics. At the same time however, many Atlantians have developed their own distinguishable culture and may even seek a sovereign, independent Atlantia."
dvg_atlantia.10.a: "The future is so far yet so near."

dvg_atlantia.1.t: "The Future of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
dvg_atlantia.1.d: "The time has come to decide who should govern [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
dvg_atlantia.1.f: "For decades now, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has remained relatively peaceful as a buffer state between [SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName] under Spanish sovereignty. However, there are an increasing amount of Atlantians seeking a different future. \n \n If we refuse to join [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName], there is a good chance their armed forces will try to pillage and raze us. We could join [SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName] for protection as they are more liberal minded like many Atlantians are, but joining them would effectively disenfranchise our Black populace due to attitudes there regarding race. Of course, we could just decide to join neither, but we might not be prepared for a future invasion from either of them."
dvg_atlantia.1.f2: "For decades now, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has remained relatively peaceful as a buffer state between Amazonie and [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName] under Spanish sovereignty. However, there are an increasing amount of Atlantians seeking a different future. \n \n With the recent victory of the Equinoxiens in abolishing slavery in [SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName], joining forces with them has become a popular option among liberals and Afro-Amerigans. However, some of the bourgeoisie in our country still see [SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName] as an unsafe place and feel it may be more practical to join [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName]. Of course, we could just decide to be independent, but we might not be prepared for a future invasion from either of them."
dvg_atlantia.1.f3: "For decades now, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has remained relatively peaceful as a buffer state between Amazonie and [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName] under Spanish sovereignty. However, there are an increasing amount of Atlantians seeking a different future. \n \n With the Equinoxiens still holding onto their independence from [SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName], joining forces with them has become a popular option among liberals and Afro-Amerigans. However, some of the bourgeoisie in our country still see [SCOPE.sCountry('eqx_scope').GetName] as an unsafe place and feel it may be more practical to join [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName] or [SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName] where their assets are less likely to be in danger. Of course, we could just decide to be independent, but we might not be prepared for a future invasion from any one of these countries."
dvg_atlantia.1.a: "We should join [SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName]!"
dvg_atlantia.1.b: "We should join [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName]!"
dvg_atlantia.1.c: "We should become independent!"
dvg_atlantia.1.e: "We should join the [SCOPE.sCountry('eqx_scope').GetName]!"

dvg_atlantia.2.t: "A Victory for Liberty"
dvg_atlantia.2.d: "After much deliberation, the Atlantians have decided to join our fledgling democracy instead of the tyrannical rule of their former masters."
dvg_atlantia.2.f: "It is unlikely De Aigle will respect this, as he is already accusing the Atlantian referendum of being rigged, not that we would know anything of course. \n \n Already, he is sending troops to our border as to assert Lotharingian hegemony on the continent. It is likely we are outmanned and outexperienced given many of Lotharingia's soldiers are civil war veterans. Can we really beat them?"
dvg_atlantia.2.a: "Vive la Democratie! Right gives us might!"
dvg_atlantia.2.b: "Let's not invite a fight we cannot win."

dvg_atlantia.3.t: "The Return of the Golden Province"
dvg_atlantia.3.d: "After much deliberation, the Atlantians have decided to rejoin our republic once more."
dvg_atlantia.3.f: "It seems like nothing beats the power of threatening violence if you don't get your way, we would know very well of course."
dvg_atlantia.3.a: "Vive la Republique!"
dvg_atlantia.3.b: "On second thought, Atlantia is better as a buffer state than under our control."

dvg_atlantia.4.t: "The Rigged Referendum"
dvg_atlantia.4.d: "Allegedly, the Atlantians voted to join [SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName] as opposed to returning to us or seeking their own independence much to our anguish."
dvg_atlantia.4.f: "These results are absolutely nonsensical, and was most likely the work of Amazonien agents bribing election officials and manipulating the results. Regardless, we must reconquer our lost land to show that we will purge corruption from the Golden Province!"
dvg_atlantia.4.a: "Cote du Cafe is Lotharian!"
dvg_atlantia.4.b: "We have better things to do."

dvg_atlantia.5.t: "Aid from Atlantia?"
dvg_atlantia.5.d: "The Atlantians are offering us aid in our fight against any attempts of a foreign power to annex us"
dvg_atlantia.5.f: "Although this might be convenient, the Atlantians seem to be doing this to set us up as a buffer-puppet state for their future ambitions. This aid could really help, but may undermine our sovereignty."
dvg_atlantia.5.a: "So what? We need all the help we can get."
dvg_atlantia.5.b: "We can win this fight on our own."

dvg_atlantia.6.t: "Nouvelle Alsace Refuses Aid"
dvg_atlantia.6.d: "The leaders of Nouvelle Alsace saw through our plan and are not interested in our help."
dvg_atlantia.6.f: "It seems like if we want to build a united Ameriga, we will have to look for other ways."
dvg_atlantia.6.a: "At least we're safe though, right?"

dvg_atlantia.7.t: "Integrating Nouvelle Alsace"
dvg_atlantia.7.d: "Our influence over Nouvelle Alsace has become so effective, they are now essentially under our control and even acclimating to our liberal ways."
dvg_atlantia.7.f: "Already, Nouvelle Alsace is seeing infrastructure development and freedom they never would have seen under De Aigle's rule. Although this undermines their whole struggle for independence, at least we share a common struggle against autocracy and they can now protect what they have. They can now be safer under better hands."
dvg_atlantia.7.a: "Vive les Amerigains! Stronger together!"

dvg_atlantia.8.t: "Integrating Atlantia"
dvg_atlantia.8.d: "Our influence over Atlantia has become so effective, they are now essentially under our control."
dvg_atlantia.8.f: "Although this undermines their whole struggle for independence, Atlantia has always been eyed for by its neighbors due to its resources. If we don't get to them, somebody else will!"
dvg_atlantia.8.a: "Vive les Amerigains! Stronger together!"

dvg_atlantia.9.t: "Atlantians supporting Separatists"
dvg_atlantia.9.d: "We have reason to believe the Atlantians are trying to undermine us. Our spies within Nouvelle Amsterdam have uncovered them sending money, troops, supplies, and training to the Nouvelsatians."
dvg_atlantia.9.f: "Since we are already trying to unite the country with the current war and Atlantia is effectively siding against us by aiding the enemy, we can take this chance to retake the Golden Province. Are we just gonna let this wasp nest of dissidents do as they please with us? Our armed forces are insisting we stop this."
dvg_atlantia.9.a: "We have never been about compromise. Atlantia Delenda Est!"
dvg_atlantia.9.b: "The House of Cards is already pretty difficult to rebuild. We can't add another card of conflict just yet."

dvg_atlantia.11.t: "The Atlantian Referendum"
dvg_atlantia.11.d: "The contested borderland between Amazonie and Lotharingia is holding a referendum on whether to join its neighbors or seek independence."
dvg_atlantia.11.f: "Originally, it was part of Lotharingia under Burgundian control, but it was later seized by the Dual Monarchy and put under their Amazonie administration. Eventually, the discovery of gold and the consequent destabilizing impact on the world economy leading it to be put under a 'Golden Board' with Spanish Sovereignty as a compromise. In spite of our recognized independence however, the European colonial powers have refused to give us a seat on this board. Over time, we have sent our people into Atlantia in hopes they will rejoin our nation."
dvg_atlantia.11.a: "Hopefully these people know what's best for them!"

dvg_atlantia.12.t: "Atlantia chooses independence!"
dvg_atlantia.12.d: "It seems in spite of our efforts, Atlantia has decided to become its own sovereign state."
dvg_atlantia.12.f: "Our administraiton is disappointed as they sure could have benefited from our protection as it now won't be as easy to gain access to market. Still, maybe can find a way to make this new country useful to us later."
dvg_atlantia.12.a: "Let's keep an eye on them so that they don't give us trouble."

dvg_atlantia.13.t: "Atlantia joins Lotharingia!"
dvg_atlantia.13.d: "Allegedly the election results have indicated that the Atlantians have decided to join Lotharingia instead of returning to us or seeking their own sovereignty."
dvg_atlantia.13.f: "Atlantia is a bastion of liberalism, so why wouldn't they join a fellow democracy? Clearly the Lotharingians must have coerced them which means the legitimacy of the referendum is questionable at best. Perhaps we can 'liberate' these poor Atlantians? Lotharingia might be a militarily threatening foe, but are we just going to let them do as they please on the continent?"
dvg_atlantia.13.a: "The torch of liberty will fly over Nouvelle Amsterdam!"
dvg_atlantia.13.b: "Let's not fight battles we cannot win."

dvg_atlantia.14.t: "Frédéric Delgrès Seeks Asylum"
dvg_atlantia.14.d: "Following the integration of Equinoxea, slavery is now legal across all of [SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName] and the government there hopes repatriate and capture escaped ex-slaves. Among them, a prominent abolitionist by the name of Frederic Delgrès hopes to seek asylum in our country."
dvg_atlantia.14.f: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is a country built by immigrants, but does that include political refugees as well? Frédéric Delgrès is one of the most prominent and divisive orators of his country. Born a slave to a Black man and a Tupi woman, Frédéric Delgrès  he served as a secretary for his master’s wife whom had remarked his intellectual capacities and taught him to read. After years of bondage  he managed to escape and continued his education in the free states of Equinoxia. There he was threatened by his former master who invoked the anti-fugitive laws. Thanks to his connections, he was able to sneak across the border into [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Upon hearing about this however, the [SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName] government has demanded we repatriate him."
dvg_atlantia.14.a: "We are a beacon of liberty for everyone!"
dvg_atlantia.14.b: "We cannot risk angering [SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName]. Maybe Lotharingia can have him instead?."
dvg_atlantia.14.c: "He would cause too much trouble here. He will have to look elsewhere."
dvg_atlantia.14.e: "Send him back to [SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName]!"

dvg_atlantia.15.t: "Integrating Gouas"
dvg_atlantia.15.d: "Our influence over Gouas has become so effective, they are now essentially under our control."
dvg_atlantia.15.f: "Although this undermines their whole struggle for independence, Gouas has always been eyed for by its neighbors due to its geography. If we don't get to them, somebody else will!"
dvg_atlantia.15.a: "Vive les Amerigains! Stronger together!"

dvg_atlantia.16.t: "A Meeting in Arariboua Hall"
dvg_atlantia.16.d: "On an island upon the Baie Dorée a stone’s throw from the former Golden Board headquarters lies the venerable Arariboua Hall."
dvg_atlantia.16.f: "To outsiders, it is merely a club gathering the elites of Atlantia but few know the truth about the power that lies within. Home of the Amerigan Society a masonic-like society that emerged in Atlantia following the establishment of the Mandate whose members are devoted to their goal of a unified Ameriga based upon liberal principles. Independence was largely gained through their actions and it was merely the first step of their plan towards the creation of a united Amerigan state.  plans are formulated to carve up Amazonia and Lotharingia to reform their failed constitutions and political systems...even if force is needed."
dvg_atlantia.16.a: "From Port Sucre to Charlemagne!"

dvg_atlantia.17.t: "Plotters in Ariraboua"
dvg_atlantia.17.d: "It seems that de Aigle’s fears towards Atlantia were not misplaced after all. His vast network of spies and other agents have already begun to bring word of liberal schemes emanating from Nouvelle Amsterdam."
dvg_atlantia.17.f: "Rumors abound of plans by reformers and radical republicans to bring serious political change to Lotharingia and point to one place : the notorious Ariraboua club which most Atlantian politicians journalists and officers frequent. de Aigle knows that this means that treason is afoot and that the liberals are planning nothing less than his removal from power and the toppling of his regime. Perhaps they even seek to have him go the way of Caesar."
dvg_atlantia.17.a: "Traitors, everywhere!"

dvg_atlantia.18.t: "The Atlantian Takeover"
dvg_atlantia.18.d: "To the bewilderment of all of Ameriga neither de Aigle’s Lotharingia nor the liberals’ New Alsace were able to achieve a decisive advantage over the other."
dvg_atlantia.18.f: "After a bitter peace of status quo was hammered out between the two states it appears that the Atlantians have decided to take matters into their own hands. The New Alsatian government has been forcibly deposed by a private army of Atlantian mercenaries and Atlantia has assumed direct control of what used to be northern Lotharingia. Though the new Atlantian regime promises to continue to protect democracy the fact that its rebirth was tainted by the original sin of New Alsace’s overthrow shall haunt the republic forever."
dvg_atlantia.18.a: "If you want anything done right, you must do it yourself."


dvg_atlantia.19.t: "Lighting the Fuses of Liberty"
dvg_atlantia.19.d: "As it currently stands Atlantia exists as an independent buffer state between [SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName]. With our network of spies and agitators however, this can change."
dvg_atlantia.19.f: "  "
dvg_atlantia.19.a: "Time to provoke Planteurs in [SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName]."
dvg_atlantia.19.b: "Let's dethrone [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName]'s Despot."




dvg_ameriga.1.t: "The Liberation of Amazonie"
dvg_ameriga.1.d: "For far too long, Afro-Amerigans and working class Amazoniens have suffered under the Planteur policies to enforce racial segregation and slavery. Today, that ends."
dvg_ameriga.1.f: " 'By virtue of the power vested in me in this time of actual armed conflict, I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves henceforward shall be free. Upon this act, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind, and the gracious favor of Almighty God. As Christ died to make men holy, many of our soldiers have died to make men free.' \n\n - [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]' "
dvg_ameriga.1.a: "By this stroke, we have brought salvation! Glory Hallelujah!" 



dvg_ameriga.2.t: "United States of Ameriga"
dvg_ameriga.2.d: "Alas, the ambitions of the Atlantian freemasons have finally been realized - an Ameriga united."
dvg_ameriga.2.f: "Now all that's left is to cement this national identity."
dvg_ameriga.2.a: "E pluribus unum!"
dvg_ameriga.2.b: "God Bless Ameriga."


dvg_ameriga.3.t: "Ameriga The Great"
dvg_ameriga.3.d: "We have successfully united much of the continent."
dvg_ameriga.3.f: "The Pan-Amerigan dream has been fulfilled! The rooster of unity cries louder than ever. The beacon of liberty shines brighter than ever. The house of steel is stronger than ever. A new world superpower has emerged!"
dvg_ameriga.3.a: "Oh my counrty tis of thee..."

dvg_ameriga.4.t: "The Collapse of Ameriga"
dvg_ameriga.4.d: "Due to the mismanagement of the newly united country, it has fallen apart to effectively cease to exist."
dvg_ameriga.4.f: "Seems like it was proabably not a good idea to form a country just to map paint instead of caring about how it's run or the people living there, y'know?"
dvg_ameriga.4.a: "Bye Bye Ameriga!"

dvg_ameriga.5.t: "South Ameriga Petitions For Annexation"
dvg_ameriga.5.d: "Due to the relative peace between the two countries claiming to be Ameriga, the south has realized it would be better to just join us."
dvg_ameriga.5.f: "The East Coast of Ameriga has now been unified!"
dvg_ameriga.5.a: "Viva Ameriga!"
