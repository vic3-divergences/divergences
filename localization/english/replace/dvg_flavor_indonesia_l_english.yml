The East Indies awaits.#!"

 dvg_polynesia.1.t: "The Tui Tonga Empire"
 dvg_polynesia.1.d: "Despite its attempts to become the unopposed hegemonic power of the Pacific Islands since the 10th century, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Empire is largely unknown outside of the region."
 dvg_polynesia.1.f: "Still, this humble yet mighty nation gets by from being a stopping point for ships trying to cross the Pacific, whether they be merchants going between Zhourao and Qingqiu, European explorers hoping to 'discover' and claim new lands, or missionaries converting us to their religion through the education they provide. For much of our history, we have been an observer nation to these developments in the outside world. Of course, with all this observing comes knowledge that surely we can put to good use!"

 dvg_lanfang.3.f: "To anyone entering through the main port, one could see the waving Guanyin statue at the temple entrance as if it was a warm sign of welcome. However, there are still some feeling alienated by the temple's construction. \n \n 'I see Guanyin for the Chinese, Garuda for the Thai, a Kannon for the Japanese and some bearded guy- maybe he represents the Europeans and Christians. Where is the Malay representation in here?' \n That would be silly, Malays are Muslim, they don't believe in statues. \n 'So much for a symbol of unity then. Now it looks like Guanyin is telling people to stop there.'"

 dvg_lanfang.4.t: "A New Temple in Pontianak"

Now they want to take our followers."\n "Not only that, but if you're entering Pontianak harbor and now you have to see these smug statues smiling and waving.

 dvg_bali.1.t: "The United Kingdom of Bali"
 dvg_bali.1.d: "Centuries have passed following the fall of the Majapahit Empire, yet some political leaders living in its former territory (known as the Nusantara) are still nostalgic for its legacy of uniting the indies. One of these leaders is [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], who has become the embodiment of the Balinese kingdoms uniting."
 dvg_bali.1.f: "Just like the old empire, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has managed to maintain Hinduism with Buddhist influences as the state religion and thus sits alone in doing so being surrounded by a sea of sultanates and colonial powers. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] difficult road ahead of it if it wants to be taken seriously as the re-uniter of the Nusantara. \n \n Seeing the success so far in uniting Bali and the Sunda Islands, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] dynasty hopes to do the same with the rest of the East Indies. However, even many of our leader's loyal supporters consider this idea far-fetched.

 dvg_bali.3.f: " In stark contrast to its more conservative, Islamic and Christian neighbors  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has more relaxed rules regarding recreatonal activities. Ever since the European and Zhourao diplomats visited the island to sign the Denpasar Accords, many have been returning regularly. Often, they write about how the island offers an sense of exotic escape and affordable leisure away from the war and conflict elsewhere. Some have been eagerly wriitng home about the joys of drinking alcohol adjacent to a Hindu temple in the lush forest backdrop. However, some of these new arrivals seem to be noted to be displaying reckless and disrespectful behaviour..."
 dvg_bali.3.a: "We are a paradise for all to enjoy."
 dvg_bali.3.b: "These people are not welcome here."
