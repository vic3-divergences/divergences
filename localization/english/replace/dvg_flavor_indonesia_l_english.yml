 je_lanfang_migration: "Sinicizing the Indies"
 je_lanfang_migration_reason: "The presence of Chinese-speaking people in the Indies seeking economic opportunities goes back centuries, with Chinatowns propping up in places like Jakarta and Singapura. Now that we finally have a Chinese-led nation achieving prosperity on its own, it is time we invite more of our bretheren to share this newfound wealth with."

 je_colonial_administration_indies: "Colonizing the East Indies"
 je_colonial_administration_indies_reason: "In order to best leverage our rule over our holdings in the East Indies, a #bold Colonial Administration#! may be established over a given region of the continent. #bold Colonial Administrations#! will expand ion their own, and may be given jurisdiction over our other regional holdings.\n\n#lore Every power in this part of the world worth a hoot is seeking slices of the strategically important region as more jewels in their crowns. Rich in untapped resources and filled with people yet to be put to work, power and prestige are the prizes for the victors. Make no mistake: blood will be spilled long before the scramble ends. The East Indies awaits.#!"
 
 je_consolidate_colonial_rule_bei: "Consolidate Colonial Rule"
 je_consolidate_colonial_rule_bei_reason: "The frontier of our Indonesian territories has proven a consistent source of risk. We are surrounded by disorderly polities under arbitrary rulers which may threaten the integrity of our territory at any time. In order to ensure the security of our core holdings, those native sovereigns who still evade our rule must be brought to heel, and any hint of popular resistance crushed before it spirals out of control.\n\nAs we expand our administration across Indonesia, we will have the opportunity to establish new [Concept('concept_princely_state', '$concept_princely_states$')] to aid our administration. Assuming direct rule over too much land will cause the [concept_liberty_desire] of our existing subjects to increase."

 je_retaking_java: "Retaking Java"
 je_retaking_java_reason: "The fall of the Majapahit Empire led many Hindu nobles, priests, and artisans to flee to Bali, which became a refuge for Hindu culture. However, should the rulers of Bali be able to conquer Java, the island can be restored to its former glory."

 je_pillager_prince_lanfang: "The Pillager Prince"
 je_pillager_prince_lanfang_reason: "Hsia Li, also known as the "Pillager Prince" has made landfall in our country. In order to adequately deal with him, we will need the proper level of police or home affairs. "

Furthermore, in 1275, the term Cakravala Mandala Dvipantara was used by him to describe the aspiration of united Southeast Asian archipelago under Singhasari and marked the beginning of his efforts to achieve it. Dvipantara is a Sanskrit word for the "islands in between", making it a synonym to Nusantara as both dvipa and nusa mean "island". Now, against the aggression of outside powers we shall stand united!"

 #Events
 
 dvg_polynesia.1.t: "The Tui Tonga Empire"
 dvg_polynesia.1.d: "Despite its attempts to become the unopposed hegemonic power of the Pacific Islands since the 10th century, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Empire is largely unknown outside of the region."
 dvg_polynesia.1.f: "Still, this humble yet mighty nation gets by from being a stopping point for ships trying to cross the Pacific, whether they be merchants going between Zhourao and Qingqiu, European explorers hoping to 'discover' and claim new lands, or missionaries converting us to their religion through the education they provide. For much of our history, we have been an observer nation to these developments in the outside world. Of course, with all this observing comes knowledge that surely we can put to good use!"
 dvg_polynesia.1.a: "Is it Tonga time? I think it's Tonga time!"

 dvg_lanfang.1.t: "A New Cultural Identity?"
 dvg_lanfang.1.d: "As [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has seen waves of immigrants from China to the southern seas since its existence, new generations born from them within the country have now begun to call this land their only home. The question has arisen on how our nation shall define itself. "

 dvg_lanfang.3.d: "A new Buddhist temple has been built in our capital, featuring gigantic, colorful statues of not only the Gautama Buddha but also various deities and spirits associated with local cultures - such as Guanyin, Garuda, Guan Yu, Vajrapani, among others."
 dvg_lanfang.3.f: "To anyone entering through the main port, one could see the waving Guanyin statue at the temple entrance as if it was a warm sign of welcome. However, there are still some feeling alienated by the temple's construction. \n \n 'I see Guanyin for the Chinese, Garuda for the Thai, a Kannon for the Japanese and some bearded guy- maybe he represents the Europeans and Christians. Where is the Malay representation in here?' \n That would be silly, Malays are Muslim, they don't believe in statues. \n 'So much for a symbol of unity then. Now it looks like Guanyin is telling people to stop there.'"
 dvg_lanfang.3.a: "A beautiful way to exhibit the multicultural heritage of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]!"

 dvg_lanfang.4.t: "A New Temple in Pontianak"
 dvg_lanfang.4.d: "A new Buddhist temple has been built in Pontianak, featuring gigantic, colorful statues of Chinese idols. This has angered the local Malay imams who have come forward to request we intervene."
 dvg_lanfang.4.f: " "First they come to our country and take our jobs, then they take our land. Now they want to take our followers."\n "Not only that, but if you're entering Pontianak harbor and now you have to see these smug statues smiling and waving. It is like these Chinese are trying to mock us with how much money they can squander on idolatry.""
 dvg_lanfang.4.a: "This temple must be dismantled."
 dvg_lanfang.4.b: "We cannot risk the ire of the Chinese."

dvg_lanfang.5.t: "Sultan of Brunei Orders Temple Destruction"
dvg_lanfang.5.d: "The construction of the temple has upset many conservative Malays our territory, to the point they have brought this up with our overlod, the Sultan of Brunei."
dvg_lanfang.5.f: "    "
dvg_lanfang.5.a: "Very well, any subject must obey their overlord."
dvg_lanfang.5.b: "We won't pay taxes towards the destruction of our heritage."

dvg_lanfang.6.t: "Insolent Guests"
dvg_lanfang.6.d: "The Governor of Pontianak has refused to allow for the destruction of the temple, citing the previous sultan gave his family autonomy over that piece of land."
dvg_lanfang.6.f: " "If we just let them do as they please, they might become a threat...""
dvg_lanfang.6.a: "Inshallah, let's show what good their so-called karma has given them."
dvg_lanfang.6.b: "Let's just keep the status quo and not complicate things."
dvg_lanfang.6.c: "Just give them independence. There's no way an independent Chinese city state can survive in the Malay archipelago, right?"

It is like he and his band of thugs are just doing as they please there.' "

dvg_lanfang.7.b: "We shall not cater to criminals."
dvg_lanfang.7.c: "We can use someone with this kind of expertise."

 
 dvg_bali.1.t: "The United Kingdom of Bali"
 dvg_bali.1.d: "Centuries have passed following the fall of the Majapahit Empire, yet some political leaders living in its former territory (known as the Nusantara) are still nostalgic for its legacy of uniting the indies. One of these leaders is [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], who has become the embodiment of the Balinese kingdoms uniting."
 dvg_bali.1.f: "Just like the old empire, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has managed to maintain Hinduism with Buddhist influences as the state religion and thus sits alone in doing so being surrounded by a sea of sultanates and colonial powers. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] difficult road ahead of it if it wants to be taken seriously as the re-uniter of the Nusantara. \n \n Seeing the success so far in uniting Bali and the Sunda Islands, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] dynasty hopes to do the same with the rest of the East Indies. However, even many of our leader's loyal supporters consider this idea far-fetched.

 dvg_bali.3.d: "As [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has become more well-known on the global stage, it has been attracting tourists from all over the world - with some deciding they do not want to leave."
 dvg_bali.3.f: " In stark contrast to its more conservative, Islamic and Christian neighbors  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has more relaxed rules regarding recreatonal activities. Ever since the European and Zhourao diplomats visited the island to sign the Denpasar Accords, many have been returning regularly. Often, they write about how the island offers an sense of exotic escape and affordable leisure away from the war and conflict elsewhere. Some have been eagerly wriitng home about the joys of drinking alcohol adjacent to a Hindu temple in the lush forest backdrop. However, some of these new arrivals seem to be noted to be displaying reckless and disrespectful behaviour..."
 dvg_bali.3.a: "We are a paradise for all to enjoy."
 dvg_bali.3.b: "These people are not welcome here."
