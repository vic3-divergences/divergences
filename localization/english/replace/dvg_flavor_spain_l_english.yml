 je_uma_gran_comunidade: "Uma Gran Mancomunidade"
 je_uma_gran_comunidade_reason: "When our brave explorers first discovered the New World, they thought that they had found a paradise on Earth. From that day forward, we have always sought to bring the glory of our empire to Arcadia and Ameriga. The time has come to finish the glorious crusade that was inaugurated centuries ago! We shall officially bring all Spanish lands of the New World under the authority of the central government, fully enfranchising their residents as citizens of our great empire. Neither Burgundy, nor Scandinavia, nor even the vaunted Dual Monarchy has been able to bind the continents together, but where they failed, we now shall succeed!

 je_army_reform_spain: "Reform the Spanish Army"
 je_army_reform_spain_reason: "The Andino's revolt against our rule in Ameriga has shown us the inadequacy of our armed forces. Many in our general staff have begun demanding reforms to be pushed through to enable us to be better prepared for future conflicts.

 je_spanish_india: "Enforce Our Claim to East India!"

 je_second_peninsular_war_SPA: "Second Peninsular War"

 je_centralize_spain_SPA: "Centralize Spain"
 je_centralize_spain_SPA_reason: "Currently, Spain is a patchwork of many kingdoms with different laws because of the different cortes within those kingdoms. We should centralize Spain to ensure that every citizens are under the same law."
 je_SPA_instability: "House of Cards"
 je_SPA_instability_reason: "Spain's cultural divide between the Spanish west and the Castilian east is a disaster in the making. If we do not solve this problem, there will be a reckoning coming for Spain."
 je_the_last_andine_war_SPA: "The Last Andine War"
 je_the_last_andine_war_SPA_reason: "Since our discovery of the Andes in the 16th century, and the first failed attempts by conquistadors like the Blessed Francisco de Pizarro, the Spanish Crown has battled against the barbarous Inca Empire. Their so-called Empire proved resilient, and their alliance with the Protestant powers allowed them to resist Spanish might for a time. But now, as the Spanish colonies have been reconquered, it falls to Spain to end the Andine Wars and bring the word of God throughout the Andes."
 je_reform_spain: "Proclaim Spain Restored!"
 je_reform_spain_reason: "When Spain was stricken from the maps of Europe due to internecine warfare and despair, many believed it was gone for good. But we, the loyal sons and daughters of the west, have never given up hope that Spain might one day be redeemed. And now, that day has come! From the western shores to the eastern highlands, all the old Spanish lands are once more within our grasp. This time we shall not seek to crush our brothers and sisters beneath our heels, but instead seek a reasoned understanding with them. Spain will be reforged along federal lines, with each cultural region accorded their autonomies while remaining loyal to the national government. The Castilians boast of being eagles, soaring into the sky, but our ascent, our resurrection, shall be even greater! Like Lazarus, Spain emerges from her tomb, restored to health and splendor! Viva Espanha!"
 je_form_iberia: "Embrace Pan-Iberianism"
 je_form_iberia_reason: "Now that we have found a way to balance the needs of the nation with the desires of its constituent cultures and regions, a sense of unity is spreading throughout our society the likes of which has never been seen before. Our success at unifying these diverse cultures has caused some political thinkers to propose that we seek to expand our goals to unify the entire Iberian Peninsula. To do this – to unite with the Catalans, Valencians, and Aragonese, and form the first truly unified Christian state in the region since the ancient Visigoths – would require us to exert tremendous influence over the eastern Iberian coast. But if the Catalans are weak enough, and if they have been forced to give up their Italian ambitions, then we might be able to bind east to west and realize the goals of pan-Iberianism."

 dvg_spain.1.t: "The Revolution of 1808 and its Consequences"
 dvg_spain.1.d: "For centuries, the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire] sustained itself on the exorbitant wealth it extracted from its colonies. This massive undertaking, however, had its costs."
 dvg_spain.1.f: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] developed a culture of conservative aristocracy backstopped by colonial wealth. The kingdom suppressed its domestic bourgeoisie while growing increasingly dependent on manufactured imports from abroad.\n\nIn 1808, the liberal King José II usurped the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] throne and attempted to introduce long-overdue liberal reforms at home. The [concept_dvg_dual_monarchy] could not accept this and backed the absolutist pretender Pedro III against José. After winning the brutal [concept_dvg_peninsular_war] in 1815, Pedro reclaimed the throne and issued his own 'Petrine Reforms'. They sharply curtailed colonial trade and reinforced the power of European-born elites, resulting in the collapse of the Mexican colonies.\n\nThe last few decades have not been kind to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFlag], and if the increasing furor of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] liberals is anything to gauge things by, the next few decades may not be kind, either."
 dvg_spain.1.a: "Viva o Rei, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] XV [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName]! Viva Espanha!"
 dvg_spain.2.t: "La Nación Dividida"
 dvg_spain.2.d: "The idea of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] as a fractured nation is not new. It was felt in the 17th century, when Miguel Cervantes published The Ingenious Gentleman Dom Quixote de los Algarves, the famous story of a mad aristocrat returning to chivalry in a modern world. This well encapsulates the divide of our nation, between liberal and conservative, maritime and terrestrial, modernity and tradition … [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and [SCOPE.sState('castile_state').GetName]. The eastern region of [SCOPE.sState('castile_state').GetName] has long chafed under the western centralization which came with the ascent of the Lorena-Aviz dynasty."
 dvg_spain.2.f: "Pedro III moved the capital to [SCOPE.sState('madrid_state').GetCityHubName] to reconnect with the neglected region, much to the anger of the west, yet even this may not have been enough. The liberals demand a return to [SCOPE.sState('lisbon_state').GetCityHubName], and the reactionaries denounce this idea with equal fire and fury. Romantic poets have begun to speak of “[SCOPE.sState('castile_state').GetName]” as something unique and rooted in ancient ways. If [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is to ever see true reform take root, the [SCOPE.sCulture('castilian_culture').GetName] question will need to be answered."
 dvg_spain.2.a: "Por uma pequena amostra podemos julgar de toda a peça."
 dvg_spain.3.t: "The Nova Reconquista"
 dvg_spain.3.d: "The radical Jose II usurped the Spanish throne in 1808, and sought to inject mad liberalism into the Spanish colonial system. King Pedro III fought back, with the Dual Monarchy’s help, in the Peninsular War, prevailing in 1815. Pedro then restored absolutism in Spain, promulgating the Petrine Reforms to consolidate the colonial administration. For some reason, this did not satisfy the insolent criollos, who declared a revolutionary Mexican Republic in 1817!"
 dvg_spain.3.f: "While we crushed it, we were not thorough enough. Now, Spanish Arcadia has taken up arms against the Crown under the banner of the Colombian Alliance. Only New Granada and Cuba remain secure. Currently, we are observing an armed truce with the Alliance. Some believe that we should finish the fight and annihilate the rebels, while more cautious ministers argue that it would be more sensible to consolidate our position in New Granada. To resume the war would be to bet the fate of Spain upon victory."
 dvg_spain.3.a: "For God, for King, for Country, destroy Colombia!"
 dvg_spain.3.b: "We must end the carnage and preserve what we have left."
 dvg_spain.4.t: "Disaster on the Horizon"
 dvg_spain.4.d: "With our soldiers still not yet in reach of the Colombian traitors’ bastion of Mexico City, the notorious Guillermo de Blanco is preparing to return to conventional warfare. Emboldened by the continued failure of the Spanish Army to subdue the Colombian Alliance, de Blanco has been rapidly rebuilding support among local New Granadan elites and military officers for an armed uprising."
 dvg_spain.4.f: "It is believed that de Blanco seeks to incite a revolution of his own in New Granada, positioning himself as de Herrera’s successor. If he were to launch such a revolt, the effort required to squash it would require all but abandoning the field of battle to the Colombians. #red It may be wise to accept the loss of New Spain and focus on preventing the loss of New Granada as well.#!"
 dvg_spain.4.a: "We cannot afford to lose both halves of the empire."
 dvg_spain.4.b: "Spain will not bow before some bandit with delusions of grandeur!"
 dvg_spain.5.t: "An Armistice to End All Colombian Wars"
 dvg_spain.5.d: "The War of Colombian Independence has devastated the New World and wreaked havoc upon Spain’s economy and political stability, not to mention the cost in human lives. So much blood has been shed, in fact, that Spain has been driven to accept the loss of the northern half of their New World colonial empire."
 dvg_spain.5.f: "In a diplomatic ceremony in Lisbon, Spain has recognized the independence of the Colombian Alliance. Joyous cries of celebration ring out from Lusitania to Andagoya, but the mood in Spain is one of fear, anxiety, and doubt towards an uncertain future. New Spain has decisively slipped from its old master’s hands."
 dvg_spain.5.a: "All who have served the Crown have plowed the sea…"
 dvg_spain.6.t: "The Nova Reconquista Completed!"
 dvg_spain.6.d: "Alleluia! Once more the Spanish banner flies over the heart of the New World, from Lusitania to Essequibo. The traitors lie vanquished before us, their armies annihilated, and the rebel cities pacified. Anastasio Vicente died fighting during the siege of Mexico City, while notorious New Granadan warlord Guillermo de Blanco and his first lieutenant Antonio Rocafuerte were apprehended in Cartagena while preparing to board an express ship to Etruria, disguised as Catholic monks."
 dvg_spain.6.f: "Rocafuerte, meanwhile, has taken power in the Republic of Cumaná. As the bandit generals lead their people in celebration of their newfound independence, the Spanish find themselves in the depths of an abyss. For the first time since 1519, Spain holds not a single inch of the New World mainland…"
 dvg_spain.6.a: "God willed it, and in His sign we have conquered!"
 dvg_spain.6.b: "Divide Colombia in three so that they can never revolt against us again!"
 dvg_spain.7.t: "The Restoration of New Spain"
 dvg_spain.7.d: "Following our total victory in the New World, the traitorous Colombian Alliance has been dismantled, its leading figures slated for trial for crimes against the Crown. A massive westward migration of bureaucracy and commerce is occurring as the old colonial system has been recreated and the Viceroyalty of New Spain restored. While this is a triumph for Spain, a country whose fortunes had otherwise been flagging as of late, a question has arisen as to whether we should take the opportunity to introduce some new reforms."
 dvg_spain.7.f: "Many have argued against this, saying that our victory in the New World has proven the liberals wrong and demonstrated that absolutism is the supreme form of government. Others, however, have asserted that if we do not seize upon this moment of royal popularity to solve some of the underlying structural problems which precipitated all of this in the first place, there is no reason that this crisis could not happen again in the future."
 dvg_spain.7.a: "I am the State, and I am victorious!"
 dvg_spain.7.b: "Some reforms will help consolidate public trust."
 dvg_spain.8.t: "The Herrerian Independence War"
 dvg_spain.8.d: "Blanco’s revolution has spread like a cancer throughout New Granada. While Rocafuerte has so far failed to incite revolt in the eastern region of New Castille, enough local western elites have been swayed to de Blanco’s cause that he effectively controls half of the colony. He has proven totally unwilling to negotiate, demanding nothing less than unconditional and immediate independence."
 dvg_spain.8.f: "This cannot be permitted! Spain must not be driven from the New World! We shall fight to the bitter end to preserve our power and fight back against the tide of radicalism!"
 dvg_spain.8.a: "Viva o Rey, viva Espanha!"
 dvg_spain.9.t: "Herreria Victorious"
 dvg_spain.9.d: "The unthinkable has occurred : Guillermo de Blanco has triumphed. Spanish forces have been beaten at every turn and forced out of Herreria, and Rocafuerte has finally driven New Castille into joining de Blanco’s revolution. The failure in New Granada has led to the total collapse of the Spanish war effort throughout the New World, as the morale of the military crashes and Spain is forced to retreat to the Caribbean."
 dvg_spain.9.f: "Left with no other options, the King of Spain has swallowed his pride and signed a peace treaty with the revolutionary leaders of the New World – such as de Blanco, the man whom Spain must now admit is the ruler of the sovereign state of Herreria. Rocafuerte, meanwhile, has taken power in the Republic of Cumaná. As the bandit generals lead their people in celebration of their newfound independence, the Spanish find themselves in the depths of an abyss. For the first time since 1519, Spain holds not a single inch of the New World mainland…"
 dvg_spain.9.a: "Meu Deus, meu Deus, por que me abandonaste?"
 dvg_spain.10.t: "The Treaty of Lisbon"
 dvg_spain.10.d: "The unthinkable has occurred : Guillermo de Blanco has triumphed. Though Spain struggled mightily, Spanish forces have suffered a series of particularly disastrous defeats which have totally shattered its armies and sent morale into an unrecoverable dive, as the New Castillians finally abandon Spain and throw their support behind Rocafuerte’s own revolution."
 dvg_spain.10.f: "Left with no other options, the King of Spain has swallowed his pride and signed a peace treaty with the revolutionary leaders of the New World – such as de Blanco, the man whom Spain must now admit is the ruler of the sovereign state of Herreria. Rocafuerte, meanwhile, has taken power in the Republic of Cumaná. As the bandit generals lead their people in celebration of their newfound independence, the Spanish find themselves in the depths of an abyss. For the first time since 1519, Spain holds not a single inch of the New World mainland…"
 dvg_spain.10.a: "Meu Deus, meu Deus, por que me abandonaste?"
 dvg_spain.11.t: "Peace in New Granada"
 dvg_spain.11.d: "Spain and Herreria have fought one another to exhaustion, with neither able to gain a decisive advantage. While Spain was ready to recognize Herreria’s independence in exchange for keeping control of New Granada, it seems that fate had other plans. Towards the close of the conflict, Rocafuerte finally amassed enough support for a revolution of his own. With many elites disillusioned by Spain’s failure to defeat de Blanco, Rocafuerte rode the tide of unrest all the way into the presidency of the revolutionary Republic of Aureliana."
 dvg_spain.11.f: "The failure of the New Granadan front has caused the entire Spanish war effort throughout the New World to disintegrate. Left with no other options, the King of Spain has swallowed his pride and signed a peace treaty with the revolutionary leaders of the New World. As the bandit generals lead their people in celebration of their newfound independence, the Spanish find themselves in the depths of an abyss. For the first time since 1519, Spain is on verge of expulsion from the New World…"
 dvg_spain.11.a: "Meu Deus, meu Deus, por que me abandonaste?"
 dvg_spain.12.t: "Granada Reconquered!"
 dvg_spain.12.d: "For all of de Blanco’s bluster and bravado, he proved to be a far less able military leader than a guerilla commander. Spanish troops, operating out of supply bases in the loyal region of New Castille, crushed the Herrerian rebels in a series of decisive battles, and secured all the major cities in western New Granada. Seeing Herreria’s failure, the Colombians have sued for peace, and we have regained control of New Granada at the expense of surrendering our claim to New Spain."
 dvg_spain.12.f: "De Blanco has been put on a clipper ship back to Spain for trial for treason, and Rocafuerte has fled into exile in Colombia. With New Granada back under rightful Spanish rule, the perseverance of our empire in the New World in at least some form has been assured. The stain of Colombia’s independence, however, will be difficult to erase from our political consciousness."
 dvg_spain.12.a: "At least we may celebrate this victory."
 dvg_spain.13.t: "The Winds of Change"
 dvg_spain.13.d: "The recovery of the Viceroyalty of New Granada, at the expense of New Spain, has sent shockwaves through the Spanish political establishment. Both liberals and conservatives are claiming victory by interpreting the event through different lenses : the former as proof that the Lorena-Aviz dynasty and its allies are a millstone around Spain’s neck, the latter that the Spanish Empire will endure, in one form or another. Perhaps both are right. Public opinion of the Lorena-Avizes is no longer abysmal, but the liberals still feel emboldened in a way not seen since 1808.
 dvg_spain.13.f: "Seizing on the Crown’s moment of weakness, they have raised voices of protest across Spain, demanding the restoration of the Josephine Constitution. Reactionaries within the royal court are aghast at the notion, reminding the king that liberalism was what tore Spain apart during the dark days of the Peninsular War. Perhaps we could grant a revised and shortened version of it as a compromise?"
 dvg_spain.13.a: "We cannot dishonor the men who died for the royal cause!"
 dvg_spain.13.b: "If it is the only way to prevent more fratricide…"
 dvg_spain.14.t: "The Dumbfounded King"
 dvg_spain.14.d: "King Afonso XV had felt reassured when he declared that there would be no restoration of the Josephine Constitution. After all, he told himself, he had resisted the demands of the liberals, and ensured that the memory of all the loyal conservative soldiers who had died in the Peninsula War would not be sullied by his own actions. Alas, it seems that others are not so sensitive to matters of historical memory. Massive protests have erupted across the nation, as liberals take to the streets to demonstrate their outrage towards the king – even Madrid was not spared violent unrest."
 dvg_spain.14.f: "When the King ordered the military to restore order, the generals decided that the time had come for the King to abdicate. After a stern conversation with a roomful of stone-faced officers, King Afonso signed a proclamation announcing his abdication and naming his young son Pedro as his heir, who shall reign as Pedro V. As the regency council announces sweeping democratic reforms, Afonso bids farewell to Madrid and to Spain."
 dvg_spain.14.a: "Well, I’ve always wanted to spend time in Paris…"
 dvg_spain.15.t: "The Lisbon Insurrection"
 dvg_spain.15.d: "The collapse of the Spanish Empire in the New World, after so much blood and treasure had been sacrificed, has been a disaster for the Lorena-Aviz dynasty. Across Spain, liberals are denouncing the king and his court, calling for his immediate abdication. Some radicals have even demanded an end to the monarchy entirely! It is these extremists who have now acted. After several days of unrest in the city of Lisbon, the local military garrison attempted to come to the aid of the municipal government and restore order."
 dvg_spain.15.f: "This operation quickly collapsed, however, as soldiers began to be swayed by the liberals’ rhetoric and a mutiny scythed through their ranks. With soldiers defecting to the radicals, the city was soon overrun. All of Lisbon is now in the hands of these rebels, with famous author and jurist [SCOPE.sCharacter('is_sales').GetFullName] acclaimed as Provisional President of their Comitê de Segurança (Security Committee). This may be the burning wick which detonates the Spanish powderkeg."
 dvg_spain.15.a: "This is a catastrophe!"
 dvg_spain.16.t: "The Toledo Junta"
 dvg_spain.16.d: "With Lisbon occupied by militant liberals, a council of Spain’s most prominent military officers led by General Julio Segura has assembled in the city of Toledo. Declaring that the “current national situation” is “inimical to the continuation of the rule of law and public safety,” they have formed an “emergency council” to “protect the nation”."
 dvg_spain.16.f: "While they have ostensibly done this to prevent a radical revolution, many of them have publicly blamed King Afonso XV for not being more diplomatic and provoking this crisis in the first place. #red If the king refuses to work with the junta, they are likely to become his most dangerous enemy.#!"
 dvg_spain.16.a: "Just who or what are they “protecting”?"
 dvg_spain.17.t: "Anarchy Looms"
 dvg_spain.17.d: "The seizure of Lisbon by radical forces, and the declaration of the Toledo junta, has polarized the nation. The royal government is rapidly ceasing to be able to function, as revolutionary sentiment spreads across western Spain, while the military and its conservative allies consolidate their position in the east."
 dvg_spain.17.f: "We find ourselves in the middle, and the situation is grim. Though surrendering to [SCOPE.sCharacter('is_sales').GetLastName]’ revolutionaries is unthinkable, the rhetoric of Segura’s junta is not encouraging, either. The situation is rapidly approaching a point of no return and we are going to have to decide whether to trust the military devil we know or the revolutionary devil we don’t."
 dvg_spain.17.a: "Between Scylla and Charybdis lies Hispania…"
 dvg_spain.18.t: "In the Palace of the King"
 dvg_spain.18.d: "King Afonso XV and his court have run out of time, and must now make a decision on which faction to throw their weight behind. It may still be possible to placate the revolutionaries by reviving the plan of some of the king’s more moderate advisors to revise and reduce the Josephine Constitution and publish the resulting document as a royal charter of rights."
 dvg_spain.18.f: "Doing so might redeem the king in the eyes of more gulli – er, less committed revolutionaries, and allow him to harness the movement against Segura’s junta. He could also do the reverse, issuing a unilateral order to the Junta to head west and destroy the revolution. While this would certainly be the simpler move, and the one which would preserve the most royal power, it rests on the assumption that the junta would not seize the opportunity to accumulate even more power for itself by executing a coup. What is the will of the king?"
 dvg_spain.18.a: "Publishing a royal charter is our only hope – make it so."
 dvg_spain.18.b: "Let’s give this unwashed mob a whiff of grapeshot!"
 dvg_spain.19.t: "The Lisbon Ultimatum"
 dvg_spain.19.d: "The proclamation of the limited royal charter of rights has failed to placate the revolutionaries. A counter-proclamation has recently been issued from Lisbon, the de facto capital of the revolutionary movement, which denounces the document as a “pale substitute of liberty” and “a dishonor to the Spanish people!”"
 dvg_spain.19.f: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('is_sales').GetLastName]’ so-called Comitê de Segurança has presented a demand on behalf of the Spanish revolutionary movement: reinstate the Josephine Constitution, in full and without any alterations, or face a new civil war. Reactionaries within the royal court are outraged at the liberals’ ingratitude, and even some moderate conservatives are angered that they would reject such generosity on behalf of the sovereign. It seems that King Afonso must decide between destroying Spanish royal power or making war upon the west."
 dvg_spain.19.a: "Better a constitutional kingdom than no kingdom at all."
 dvg_spain.19.b: "The army will show these traitors the price of their impudence!"
 dvg_spain.20.t: "A Question of Capitals"
 dvg_spain.20.d: "Now that the threat of civil war has been eliminated, a significant amount of wind has been taken out of the revolutionaries’ sails. Most of western Spain is now returning to law and order – most, but not all. The hardcore radicals have dug in within Lisbon, thought they are now reduced to demanding the return of the national capital to their city. They have made all sorts of arguments as to why this is necessary, which ultimately boil down to their fears of continued conservative domination if the capital remains in the east."
 dvg_spain.20.f: "Many conservatives have reacted with scorn to this proposal, sharply rebuking the liberals for daring to continue to make demands upon the sovereign after he has already graciously permitted such massive reforms. This may very well be the last significant decision which King Afonso personally makes in his capacity as head of state. Shall the capital return to Lisbon?"
 dvg_spain.20.a: "No, why would we give the traitors another reward?"
 dvg_spain.20.b: "Yes, it will simplify matters in the long run."
 dvg_spain.21.t: "The Lisbon Massacre"
 dvg_spain.21.d: "When General Segura and the rest of the Toledo Junta learned of the liberals’ intransigence regarding the capital, even after the king had restored the Josephine Constitution, they decided to finally take action to root out the would-be revolutionaries. Marshaling their forces, they descended upon the city determined to destroy the radicals – and destroy they did."
 dvg_spain.21.f: "Hundreds of people were shot down in the streets, with the liberals totally outgunned by the army. [SCOPE.sCharacter('is_sales').GetLastName] himself was tried by a military tribunal, convicted, and hanged in front of the Cathedral of Saint Mary Major. Lisbon has been recaptured, but the death toll is staggering. Many wonder if this blood-soaked affair is a sign of things to come in Spain’s fragile new democracy."
 dvg_spain.21.a: "An inauspicious beginning, to be sure…"
 dvg_spain.22.t: "The Coup of [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.GetString]"
 dvg_spain.22.d: "When King Afonso ordered Segura to take decisive action against the revolutionaries, he obeyed – in a way. Decisive action was taken, but not against the revolutionaries. Instead, the junta concluded that the greatest danger to Spain was not the rebels in Lisbon, but King Afonso himself. Thus, they marched north to Madrid, their forces easily overwhelming the city garrison and reaching the royal palace. There they explained to Afonso that he and the rest of the royal family were to immediately abdicate and depart for the Dual Monarchy."
 dvg_spain.22.f: "Afonso attempted to protest, but the generals made it clear that they blamed him and his intransigence for creating the crisis and warned him that many revolutionaries would be angered at the notion of the Lorena-Avizes leaving Spain alive. By ensuring his family’s safe exile, they were already being quite merciful. King Afonso had no choice but to sign a pronouncement declaring his abdication, handing power over to the junta."
 dvg_spain.22.a: "What shall they do with their newfound power?"
 dvg_spain.23.t: "The Spanish Revolution"
 dvg_spain.23.d: "When the Toledo Junta forced King Afonso to abdicate, many feared that Segura would seize all power for himself and ignite a war with the revolutionaries in the west. These pessimists were astonished when, instead, the Junta proclaimed its “investment and entrusting of all sovereign power” in the Lisbon rebels!"
 dvg_spain.23.f: "The Comitê de Segurança quickly convened an assembly of representatives to establish a new government. What emerged from this legal crucible was nothing less than a republic – a constitutional, democratic republic, the likes of which have not been seen since the tumult which preceded the Great German Wars. Crowned heads across Europe feel the growing shadow of an enemy they thought long dead, as republicanism rises from the ashes. A revolution has been carried out at the edge of Europe, but surely its influence shall soon be made manifest across the continent – including the energizing of its enemies."
 dvg_spain.23.a: "Like the sun upon the sky, we greet the rising of the Republic!"
 dvg_spain.24.t: "The Matter of the Fueros"
 dvg_spain.24.d: "For centuries, Castile and other parts of Spain have enjoyed a complex system of separate legal codes under the name of the “fueros.” When the Lorena-Aviz dynasty began to centralize more and more power towards the western coast of Spain, particularly around Lisbon, the fueros allowed the Castilians to resist their efforts and force the kings of Spain to accommodate to local realities. This system was brought crashing to the ground by King José II, who issued the Lisbon Proclamation in 1809 which destroyed the fueros in the name of modernizing Spanish law and administration."
 dvg_spain.24.f: "However, the victory of the Pedristas in the Peninsular War restored the fueros, and the Castilians have been using them to resist our attempts to centralize Spain. Our government is now considering whether to revive the Lisbon Proclamation and attempt once more to dismantle the fueros. Doing so would be a tremendous victory over the backwards, feudal nature of Spanish law, but would also outrage the Castilians."
 dvg_spain.24.a: "We must tear down this whole rotten system!"
 dvg_spain.24.b: "Abolition would be far too dangerous at this time."
 dvg_spain.25.t: "Spaniards in Paris"
 dvg_spain.25.d: "Our fair capital is no stranger to famous guests, but the new arrivals shocked even the most jaded Parisians: King Afonso XV of Spain, and most of the Lorena-Aviz royal family! He has quickly contacted the royal court, where we have learned the details of his overthrow. Afonso was quick to blame a sinister conspiracy between liberal extremists and traitorous army officers, who have now joined forces to seize Spain and proclaim a republic!"
 dvg_spain.25.f: "Anglois reactionaries are apoplectic over the affair : Spain was one of our closest allies, not to mention a shining bastion of the Catholic faith. Its loss to the republican menace is a bitter blow to all of Europe. Now, many conservatives are demanding that we intervene in Spain to overthrow the liberals and reinstall Afonso, like our liberation of Spain from José II in the Peninsular War of 1808-1815. Of course, launching such a colossal war would destabilize Europe even further, and might invite our enemies to aid the Spanish Republic."
 dvg_spain.25.a: "We shall destroy the revolution and save Spain like our forefathers!"
 dvg_spain.25.b: "A major European war would be horrendous, recognize the Republic."
 dvg_spain.26.t: "The Second Peninsular War"
 dvg_spain.26.d: "For the second time in decades, the Dual Monarchy has declared war upon Spain, ostensibly its ally. It has done so as it did in 1808 : to destroy Spanish liberalism and restore a conservative to the throne. That they are doing so now to restore the recently ousted king, Afonso XV, rather than a mere pretender, matters little to the Spanish people. They are now bracing for yet more carnage, with General Segura and the dashing young Major-General Francisco Aguirre leading Spain into battle."
 dvg_spain.26.f: "Yet while the Spanish people once fought in the name of a king of their own, now they are doing so for new reasons. If you asked the more intellectual among them, they would speak of liberalism, republicanism, democracy, and the consent of the governed. They would speak of the ways in which the Lorena-Aviz dynasty has mired Spain in backwardness and repression, and how the Anglois have acted in concert with them. However, for the common Spanish citizen, the reason to fight is summed up in a single phrase."
 dvg_spain.26.a: "Não passaram!"
 dvg_spain.27.t: "Navarre Defies Us!"
 dvg_spain.27.d: "As part of our war effort against the illegitimate Spanish Republic, we had sent an envoy to Navarre to confirm that Anglois land and naval forces would be allowed passage through the country en route to Spain. This was expected to be a simple matter of transit, but it seems that the Navarrese have taken the opportunity to make some sort of absurd stand. Denouncing us as an “aggressive menace,” the Navarrese have refused to give our military passage!"
 dvg_spain.27.f: "While much of the Anglois military is outraged by this affront, some members of the royal court have brought up the topic of the Plantagenets’ old claims to Navarre. This incident could give us the opportunity to “remind” the Navarrese of our claim, threatening to occupy and annex them if they do not obey us. #red We should be cognizant that our neighbors, particularly Aragon, would be alarmed at such an ultimatum, and may take action to prevent us from conquering Navarre.#!"
 dvg_spain.27.a: "We will not be bullied by a speck upon the map!"
 dvg_spain.27.b: "The mightiest nation in the world is above such pettiness."
 dvg_spain.28.t: "The Republic Triumphant"
 dvg_spain.28.d: "Victory is ours! The Spanish Republic has endured the savage Anglois’ attempt to foist the Lorena-Aviz back onto the Spanish throne, and the Plantagenets have been publicly humiliated by their failure. Outplanned by the wise General Segurra, and outfoxed by the clever Major-General Aguirre, they have been forced to recognize our government and disavow the Lorena-Avizes. The world, which was shocked by our rise, has now been astonished by our prevailing over the Anglois menace : liberals throughout the world shall surely be inspired by our mighty example."
 dvg_spain.28.f: "The republic’s victory has won the trust of many Spaniards, who are now cautiously willing to have faith in Spain’s new democratic experiment. The monarchist cause lies in ruins as liberalism continues to advance, leading Spain into modernity. Perhaps the blood which we have spilled together as one people shall consecrate our efforts to reforge Spain into a free and united nation."
 dvg_spain.28.a: "Like Athens against Persia, democracy has defeated tyranny!"
 dvg_spain.29.t: "L’humiliation"
 dvg_spain.29.d: "To the confoundment of the entire Anglois military, we have failed in our efforts to cast down the Spanish Republic. Due to our inability to defeat the liberal menace, the Lisbon regime has forced us to the negotiating table. In the resulting peace treaty, we have been forced to recognize them as the legitimate successors to the Kingdom of Spain, and publicly disavow Afonso and the rest of the Lorena-Aviz dynasty."
 dvg_spain.29.f: "The Lorena-Avizes are already preparing to leave for Plantagenia, but for us there can be no flight into exile to flee from our failures. There is only an uncertain future, with a liberal republic at our doorstep…and its wretched example giving inspiration to legions of traitors and separatists in both England and Occitania."
 dvg_spain.29.a: "Merde!"
 dvg_spain.30.t: "A Catástrofe"
 dvg_spain.30.d: "The republican dream has perished beneath the onslaught of Anglois shot and cannonade. The wicked alliance of Anglois and Spanish monarchists scythed through the countryside, butchering all who resisted them, before descending with rapine and slaughter upon Lisbon, brutally sacking the city. General Segurra was merely forced into retirement, but Major-General Aguirre was executed by the Anglois."
 dvg_spain.30.f: "Throughout the nation, anyone remotely associated with anti-republicanism has taken the opportunity to settle personal scores against any liberal, knowing that the occupiers would shield them. The result has been a cascade of violence and internecine warfare, as village after village attempts to purge itself of the “traitors” in its midst. The Dual Monarchy cares not for the carnage they have caused, only for the treaty by which the war was ended. Said treaty placed Afonso back on the throne and confirmed the fueros, while transferring multiple colonies to Anglois rule as payment for their efforts."
 dvg_spain.30.a: "Os fortes fazem o que querem e os fracos sofrem o que devem."
 dvg_spain.31.t: "The Dual Monarchy Pursues Diplomacy"
 dvg_spain.31.d: "In order to prevent a conservative uprising, which may have occurred had King Afonso and the Lorena-Aviz family been executed (as some radicals wished), the Toledo Junta instead allowed them to go into exile in the Dual Monarchy. Many liberals feared that this would lead the Dual Monarchy to attempt to restore Afonso to the Spanish throne."
 dvg_spain.31.f: "Thankfully, this has not occurred. An Anglois diplomatic envoy arrived in Lisbon today, bearing official documents which recognized the Spanish Republic as the legitimate successor to the Kingdom of Spain, and which formally opened diplomatic relations between our governments. It seems as though the “Anglois Menace,” so hated by radical republicans, will leave us be for now."
 dvg_spain.31.a: "The Anglois lion sleeps tonight."
 dvg_spain.32.t: "The Future of Spain"
 dvg_spain.32.d: "In one way or another, Spain has been reunified – in theory. The aversion of civil war has only been the first step in the journey towards national healing. What is needed now is a comprehensive review of Spanish society, and the government’s role within it."
 dvg_spain.32.f: "Politicians and writers across the nation have begun fighting battles of words and ideas, each seeking to advance their own plans for the revival of Spanish fortunes. Whichever set of voices win out and make themselves heard above the din shall decide the fate of Spain."
 dvg_spain.32.a: "À frente!"
 dvg_spain.33.t: "The Decline and Fall of the Madrid Economy"
 dvg_spain.33.d: "With Lisbon’s reinstatement as the Spanish capital, Madrid has seen its prospects plummet. Less than a century ago, Madrid was little more than a royal hunting lodge, an appendage of Toledo. It was only Pedro III’s efforts to move the capital eastwards and reject the coastal establishment, and the necessary reorienting of the bureaucracy, which drew any sort of prosperity to Madrid. Now that even this is gone, the city has suffered an abrupt economic decline. Every day, more people are leaving the city for good, moving to Lisbon or some other, more prominent city."
 dvg_spain.33.f: "Shops are closing by the dozen, merchants are deserting the city, and nearly all manifestations of foreign capital are vanishing. For those who remain – the Castilians who have called Madrid home for centuries – the sharp pain of the economic loss only compounds their bitterness, and their sense of being used by the uncaring elite of the coast. Some Castilians have even called for the easterners to “reclaim” Madrid as their own symbol."
 dvg_spain.33.a: "I never liked Madrid much, anyway."
 dvg_spain.34.t: "The Monopolization of Land in Spain"
 dvg_spain.34.d: "Despite recent depredations upon the Spanish population, as well as substantial colonial migration in the days of the Empire, the lands of our nation have not wanted for lack of tenants – quite the opposite. Many communities can no longer acquire the land which they need to survive, dependent as they are upon a mostly rural lifestyle of farming and herding. A significant contributor to this problem is the vast amounts of land held by the Catholic Church. Centuries of pious Spaniards willing their lands to the Church, as well as the Church’s own efforts to consolidate holdings around its many monasteries, has led to the Church controlling an outsized percentage of land in Spain." 
 dvg_spain.34.f: "The Church, obviously, does not pay taxes, which means that our treasury is also left wanting. The matter is beginning to rise to national debate, as liberals decry this “ecclesiastical hoarding,” and even pragmatic conservatives question if our arrangements with Rome may need alteration."
 dvg_spain.34.a: "A solution will have to be found."
 dvg_spain.35.t: "Nationalization of Church Land?"
 dvg_spain.35.d: "Many Spanish liberals have concluded that the simplest way to deal with the church land is to seize it. Leading anti-clerical jurists have made a strong case that there is in fact no law which forbids the Spanish government from nationalizing most Spanish lands held by the Catholic Church."
 dvg_spain.35.f: "The arguments for doing so are numerous. By seizing and then selling off the land to small landowners, we would cultivate the creation and growth of a Spanish middle class not confined to urban centers, and one which would use the land far more efficiently than the monasteries ever have – or so the liberals claim. The Spanish treasury would also greatly benefit from selling these lands off to future taxpayers, and the local aristocrats would be pleased at a chance to weaken the Church, their eternal rival. Conservatives are, of course, disturbed by the idea, but some concede that it may be financially necessary. Of course, if we go through with this, it is likely that the strongest protest will come from Rome."
 dvg_spain.35.a: "Jesus lived among beggars, surely monks can as well."
 dvg_spain.35.b: "And consign our souls to Hell? Never!"
 dvg_spain.36.t: "Arrival of the Papal Legate"
 dvg_spain.36.d: "News of the Spanish government’s imminent nationalization of church land has caused His Holiness the Pope to take action. A Papal legate has arrived in the capital, with an urgent message for our government. The Holy Father, he explains, is greatly unnerved at our plans to confiscate most Spanish ecclesiastical lands. Rather than immediately denounce us, however, the Pope wishes to arrange a meeting between himself and our top officials to attempt to come to some sort of agreement." 
 dvg_spain.36.f: "While His Holiness would of course prefer that the matter of ecclesiastical confiscation was entirely dropped, he is aware of the dire state of Spanish finances. Thus, he might be willing to accept such a move if certain political concessions were made towards the Catholic Church in return. Doing so would be seen as a betrayal of liberal principles by some, but it could avert further political strife."
 dvg_spain.36.a: "Dismiss the legate, and enact the confiscations as soon as possible."
 dvg_spain.36.b: "We will attend a meeting in Rome for negotiations."
 dvg_spain.36.c: "This was a mistake, cancel the confiscations."
 dvg_spain.37.t: "Quanta Cura"
 dvg_spain.37.d: "“When all restraints are removed by which men are kept on the narrow path of truth, their nature, which is already inclined to evil, propels them to ruin. Experience shows, even from earliest times, that cities renowned for wealth and splendor perished because of them becoming wholly overwhelmed and subsumed by the endless desire for further agglomeration. This impulse, this drive towards amassment not because of thrift and sagacity in pursuit of magnanimity, but as an end in and of itself, is born not from Almighty God, but from the false idols which His prophets rightfully condemned.”"
 dvg_spain.37.f: "In reaction to the Spanish ecclesiastical confiscations, the Pope has published a new encyclical, Quanta Cura (Condemning Current Errors). It is a withering criticism of our actions, equating secularism with greed and vanity. Catholic intellectuals across Europe have begun echoing his condemnations, to our detriment."
 dvg_spain.37.a: "Surely nobody actually believes this drivel…!"
 dvg_spain.38.t: "An Audience with His Holiness"
 dvg_spain.38.d: "The most powerful and influential members of our government have met with the Holy Father in a secretive meeting in Rome, in order to discuss the issue of ecclesiastical confiscations. As the negotiations progressed, it became clear that the Pope was willing to allow them to occur, but only if we could provide some tangible demonstration that we did not intend to use them as the opening wedge to destroy Catholicism in Spain. Further discussion drifted towards one particular idea: enshrining Catholicism as the state religion."
 dvg_spain.38.f: "Though previously taken for granted, the status of the Church has been the subject of fierce debate lately. Such a vivid and permanent gesture on our part would go a long way towards allaying the Pope’s fears. Naturally, doing so would outrage and disgust most liberals, who have an extremely low opinion of the entire Church and would abhor making such a concession to obtain what was supposed to be a measure to greatly weaken its influence in Spain."
 dvg_spain.38.a: "Spain is a Catholic nation and we shall not deny it."
 dvg_spain.38.b: "Try to concoct a maze of meaningless prose to satisfy him instead."
 dvg_spain.39.t: "Immortale Dei"
 dvg_spain.39.d: "”The Almighty has appointed the charge of the human race between two powers, the ecclesiastical and the civil, the one being set over Divine, and the other over human things, with each having their fixed limits. But just as it might come to pass that one and the same thing might belong to the jurisdiction and determination of both, therefore God, who foresees all things, and who is the author of these two powers, has marked out the course of each in right correlation to the other. Jesus Christ has Himself given command that what is Caesar's is to be rendered to Caesar, and that what belongs to God is to be rendered to God.”"
 dvg_spain.39.f: "Our meeting with His Holiness the Pope ended badly. The Pope, upset by our attempts to outfox him, published an encyclical, Immortale Dei, condemning secularism and its encroachment upon the Church. While it does not call out our government explicitly many Catholics have interpreted it as a public statement of Papal displeasure."
 dvg_spain.39.a: "How ungrateful of him."
 dvg_spain.40.t: "The Spanish Concordat"
 dvg_spain.40.d: "In a diplomatic coup which would go down in history if our negotiators had the freedom to speak their full minds on the matter, we have satisfied the Pope’s wishes without actually giving up anything of importance. A diplomatic agreement has been concluded between us and the Holy Father in which the role of the Catholic Church within several aspects of Spanish civil society has been reaffirmed."
 dvg_spain.40.f: "Nowhere in said document, however, have we stipulated that the Catholic Church is in any way bound to the state, or that the state is unquestionably obligated to support it. While Catholics across Europe hail the Concordat as a victory for the faithful, we know that it is in truth merely a way to keep the Pope at arms’ length from now on."
 dvg_spain.40.a: "And His “Holiness” is none the wiser."
 dvg_spain.41.t: "The Jimena Chronicles"
 dvg_spain.41.d: "Castilian historian Alberto González has published a controversial new book, “The Jimena Chronicles.” Current scholarship holds that Spain was weak until the House of Lorena-Aviz took the throne in the early fifteenth century and brought it glory. González has argued instead that the Jimenas, who ruled Castile-Leon (later Spain) from the twelfth to fifteenth centuries, deserve the credit. It was Afonso VII de Jimena, he argues, who first claimed the title of “Emperor of Hispania,” and the Jimenas’ greatest rivals were the Portuguese."
 dvg_spain.41.f: "He then compares archaeological data of the standard of living in Spain, particularly in Castile, during the Jimena and the Lorena-Aviz eras. He argues that while the Jimenas maintained a good standard of living across Spain, the Lorena-Aviz dynasty saw wealth drain away from the interior towards the coasts. The book intimates that the Portuguese usurped Spain to subordinate Castile’s resources for themselves. If we don’t censor this work soon, we may soon hear it quoted across Castile."
 dvg_spain.41.a: "Censorship is illiberal, but in this case may be needed."
 dvg_spain.41.b: "What harm can one book, from TOLEDO of all places, do?"
 dvg_spain.42.t: "The Asturian Trial"
 dvg_spain.42.d: "A recent incident in Asturias has demonstrated the extent to which the fueros still influence our nation. Rafael Luis de Jovellanos, an Asturian and formerly the Spanish treasurer, was recently charged with embezzling the government, classified as treason in Spain, but successfully filed a change of venue from Lisbon to Oviedo. His reasoning was that he, a reactionary and former Alfonsista, would not receive a fair trial in “radical” Lisbon. This proved disastrous – Jovellanos was easily able to find a man to use the Asturian fueros to sabotage the prosecution."
 dvg_spain.42.f: "His defense attorney, Xuan Casona, employed shocking legal chicanery to win the case. After getting a considerable amount of evidence thrown out since it was not collected according to Asturian laws, Casona was able to have Jovellanos acquitted. The whole case has made a mockery of Spanish law and has infuriated liberals, who see the entire Spanish judiciary as infected with reaction."
 dvg_spain.42.a: "Why did the judge permit this travesty!?"
 dvg_spain.43.t: "The Matter of the Fueros"
 dvg_spain.43.d: "The recent acquittal of former treasurer Rafael de Jovellanos due to loopholes in Asturian law has enraged much of western Spain. Liberals from Porto to Cadiz are apoplectic, infuriated that a few feudal laws and (they allege) corrupt connections were able to subvert Spanish justice. Many are demanding a retrial, but under the Asturian fueros, to try Jovellanos again for the same crime would be illegal. However, due to treason being a federal offense, the government could appeal the ruling and seek to bring the case to the Spanish Supreme Court."
 dvg_spain.43.f: "If Jovellanos were to then be convicted, said conviction could then be used to declare the fueros themselves contrary to national law. This would have colossal ramifications, but could inspire massive resistance from places like Asturias and Castile which have clung to the fueros for centuries."
 dvg_spain.43.a: "A retrial is clearly needed, but the fueros can stay."
 dvg_spain.43.b: "The time has come to tear down the whole rotten system!"
 dvg_spain.44.t: "The Castilian Courts Suggest a Compromise"
 dvg_spain.44.d: "Jovellanos’ case, once brought to the Supreme Court, rapidly fell apart – the government was able to bring the full weight of its evidence to bear against him and secure a conviction of treason. He will soon wear the hangman’s necktie, but the Castilian courts were alarmed by the ways in which the Supreme Court’s verdict seemed to be an indictment of the fueros. They realized that allowing such a statement by the Supreme Court to go unchallenged could enable the national government to destroy the fueros."
 dvg_spain.44.f: "Now some of the most famous Castilian jurists and legal scholars, led by Felipe Gullón Serrano, head of the University of Valladolid School of Law, have drafted a manifesto to the government. It suggests transforming the fueros into a modern form of structured autonomy, allowing regions like Asturias and Castile to keep certain rights while closing loopholes such as those employed by Jovellanos. Following this plan might curb separatism but would entrench the essence of the fueros within Spain’s laws."
 dvg_spain.44.a: "Discard the manifesto, and pass the bill ending the fueros!"
 dvg_spain.44.b: "Adopt the manifesto and use it to draft a new bill."
 dvg_spain.45.t: "The Birth of Castilian Nationalism"
 dvg_spain.45.d: "“¡Yo soy un Castellano! Castilla es una nación! (I am a Castilian! Castile is a nation!)”"
 dvg_spain.45.f: "Eight words encompass the radical transformation which has taken place in eastern Spain over the last few decades. Ideas of identity based on language, culture, geography, and tradition have finally fused with longstanding economic, political, and religious grievances among the easterners. The concerted effort to identify a unique Castilian language and ethnicity within the historical lands of the Crown of Castile-Leon have been the final step of the emergence of a Castilian identity. Enraged by the unrelenting centralism of Lisbon, these Castilian nationalists are pushing for unprecedented amounts of Castilian autonomy, with many demanding independence. #red This is an existential threat to Spain. If it is not addressed, then we will be torn apart, and perhaps even disintegrate like the Cordoban caliphate did in the time of the Reconquista.#!"

 dvg_spain.46.b: "The delusions of eastern Spaniards do not concern us."
 dvg_spain.47.t: "The New Spanish Railway Network"
 dvg_spain.47.d: "With the development of locomotive technology in Spain, the government has convened a panel of engineers and scientists to determine the optimal layout of the new Spanish rail system. The most pressing issue is which region to prioritize. While the entire nation will hopefully be joined together by rail at some point in the future, our resources are limited and so we should consider which part of the nation would benefit the most from being the first to receive this new infrastructure."
 dvg_spain.47.f: "Most liberals feel that Lisbon, and the western coast in general, is the natural first step in the interconnection of Spain. This would bring even more prosperity and efficiency to an already developed region, but a vocal minority have pointed out that rail technology would be a great aid to the chronically neglected inland regions. This has proven a thorny topic, as those who have advocated for prioritizing the east have been accused of being Castilian nationalists plotting to undermine the rest of Spain."
 dvg_spain.47.a: "Trains shall pull the east into modernity!"
 dvg_spain.47.b: "Let us bring trains to enlightened people, not ignorant farmers."
 dvg_spain.48.t: "Formation of the Liga Castellana"
 dvg_spain.48.d: "Castile has continued to chafe under Spanish rule. The rise of Castilian nationalism, and the desire to promote their cause, has led Castilian historian-turned-politician and author of the (in)famous “Jimena Chronicles,” Alberto González, to form the Liga Castellana (Castilian League). This group seeks the restoration of the medieval Crown of Castile as an autonomous kingdom within Spain, as well as the defense of the fueros and the preservation of traditional land rights from private speculators."
 dvg_spain.48.f: "The Liga has avoided advocating immediate independence – at least for now – but they have heartily endorsed Castilian nationalism, and their entrance into the mainstream political consciousness has in turn further spurred the ongoing Castilian cultural revival. Plays, books, and songs in the Castilian language have become symbols of the Liga, and González has even begun to give presentations on Castilian culture in foreign universities! If we do not solve the Castilian question soon then the Liga may become dangerously powerful."
 dvg_spain.48.a: "It’ll never catch on."
 dvg_spain.49.t: "Entrenchment of Castilian Nationalism"
 dvg_spain.49.d: "“Ten years ago, at the gate of Peñafiel Castle, my fellow Castilian patriots and I swore an oath that we would not rest until the reality of the Castilian nation was acknowledged. In those ten years, Castile has risen from the ashes. Not just in the hills and valleys, but in towns and cities, Castilians are reclaiming their fatherland.” - Alberto González"
 dvg_spain.49.f: "The Liga Castellana celebrated its tenth anniversary today, and its popularity continues to grow. The increasing urbanization of Castile has led to a reaction among middle- and lower-class Basques, Castilians, and Galicians against the Portuguese upper classes of the west, who own many new businesses and factories across Spain. These groups have found a shared cause in romanticizing the Jimena dynasty and the medieval era of northern Spain, and in defending their fueros and traditional Catholicism. Basque, Castilian, and Galician nationalist groups influenced by the Liga Castellana are becoming a regular sight in the cities beyond Portugal."
 dvg_spain.49.a: "Castile remains Spanish!"
 dvg_spain.50.t: "La Confederación Nacional del Trabajo"
 dvg_spain.50.d: "Basque, Castilian and Galician labor unions have all been experiencing both government repression and alienation from more traditional, Spanish-dominated groups. At the same time, the dominance of landlords across the south has kept most small farmers and herders from owning much land, instead forced into wage slavery. Privatization of communal lands has exacerbated this to the point that many southerners have moved to the north in desperate search of work. Now a new organization has arisen which seeks to unite all four communities against the western elites."
 dvg_spain.50.f: "Known as the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo, the CNT aims to organize urban workers in the north and rural workers in the south under a single union. Steeped in Blanquism, they wish to own the means of production and to redistribute land from landlords to the people. They have already made enemies across the upper class, and are alleged to be indoctrinating their members to form armed militias to defend workers against the “bourgeoisie” and their agents."
 dvg_spain.50.a: "Red lunatics!"
 dvg_spain.51.t: "Formation of Acción Nacional"
 dvg_spain.51.d: "A new group, the Partido de Acción Nacional (National Action Party), combines revolutionary collectivism with xenophobia. It is led by Sancho Zabalbeascoa (born Sancho Vázques), a Leonese lawyer who claims descent from Basque nobles who settled in the west during the Reconquista."
 dvg_spain.51.f: "In his manifesto, “Esketa” (Awakening), Zabalbeascoa asserts that the “pure Vasco-Castilian race, untainted by Moorish or Jewish miscegenation” unlike the “Afro-Semitic barbarians of the west,” is the “sole rightful inheritor of Iberia.” Declaring that the northern Iberians were the only ones to “remain unconquered, standing firm in our homeland, always true to our Catholic faith,” he has called for the “annihilation” of “liberalism, Protestantism, centralism, international capitalism,” and “all the other poisoned fruit of the maketo.” He calls for a return to the countryside and the liberation of its people from “their cosmopolitan enslavers." AN’s paramilitary wing, the Black Eagles, have engaged in violent brawls with political rivals across Spain."

 dvg_spain.52.d: "The victory of the proletariat over the bourgeois is not yet complete. While we have mostly destroyed the enemies of the people in the west, in the east the old masters of capital have entrenched themselves amongst the hereditary reactionaries of Castile. Here, in this land of churches, manors, and aristocrats, the virulent strain of reaction has infected vast swaths of the region. Denouncing our virtuous crushing of the old fetters of society as an assault upon their “way of life,” they have sought to delay the inevitable victory of the working class."
 dvg_spain.52.f: "Every day, loyal defenders of the proletariat report new acts of sabotage, wrecking, and other despicable treason against the people by this Castilian reactionary scum. It is corroding the entire machinery of the party, and if we do not resolve it soon then it may wreak havoc."
 dvg_spain.52.a: "Death to all enemies of the revolution!"
 dvg_spain.53.t: "The Castilian Menace"
 dvg_spain.53.d: "As we consolidate the National Rejuvenation, we must face its internal enemies. None of these are more prominent than the Castilians. For decades, these despicable parasites have feasted upon the wealth of the very nation which they scorn and dare to pretend is not their own. Their priests and lords fill the minds of their people with all manner of traitorous lies."
 dvg_spain.53.f: "Denouncing our virtuous crushing of the enemies of the people as an assault upon their “way of life,” they have sought to prevent the final victory of the true sons and daughters of Spain. Every day, loyal defenders of Hispania report new crimes which bring dishonor to the Spanish people. It is becoming an epidemic, plaguing our whole national body, and if we do not resolve it soon then it may wreak havoc."
 dvg_spain.53.a: "We must find a solution to this Castilian problem."
 dvg_spain.54.t: "Conservatism in the New Republican Era"
 dvg_spain.54.d: "With the abolition of the monarchy, new ideas of republicanism and secularism have gained national prominence. Predictably, the consolidation of the national government and culture under these new ideas has angered and frightened conservatives. They pine for the days of their fathers, of churches and crowns, and though this may sound like pathetic fantasy to some, they are still politically influential."
 dvg_spain.54.f: "Furthermore, the republican character of our new nation has disturbed the Castilians of the east, who note with growing alarm the ways in which we are dismantling the old monarchist regime. They are well aware that their unique codes and laws were inexorably tied to the crown : its loss places them in jeopardy. We have freed Spain from autocracy, but we must remain vigilant, for republics never want for lack of Catilines and Caesars."
 dvg_spain.54.a: "The light of liberty shall never be extinguished!"
 dvg_spain.55.t: "The Autonomy Bill"
 dvg_spain.55.d: "A measure has recently come before the national legislature which seeks to address the increasing unrest in eastern Spain. Known as the “Autonomy Bill,” it would expand and empower regional governors across Castile. Proponents of the bill argue that it would allow the Castilians to exercise internal freedom without resorting to more drastic partitions of the nation, and that it would reduce the risk of autocratic measures being imposed unilaterally from Lisbon."
 dvg_spain.55.f: "Of course, most of western Spain is adamantly opposed to such a measure, with one Portuguese politician describing it as “drawing the diagram of cuts of meat upon the Spanish bull.” A few moderates have proposed to amend the bill to expire in a year and require renewal to continue, at which point we could simply allow it to lapse, but even this would be seen by the Castilians as a knife in the back."
 dvg_spain.55.a: "Pass the bill as it is, we need a solution!"
 dvg_spain.55.b: "Pass the bill with the amendment, this is already dangerous."
 dvg_spain.56.t: "[SCOPE.sCulture('castilian_culture').GetName] Nationalists Rally in [SCOPE.sState('madrid_state').GetName]"
 dvg_spain.56.d: "The Autonomy Bill, even after its passage, has inflamed [SCOPE.sCulture('castilian_culture').GetName] nationalists across Spain. Unsatisfied with the measure, which they deem a mere distraction from [SCOPE.sCulture('castilian_culture').GetName] independence, they have converged on [SCOPE.sState('madrid_state').GetName] to demonstrate the strength and popularity of their movement and put pressure on the government. From across the east, [SCOPE.sCulture('castilian_culture').GetName] activists, politicians, and patriots have gathered in [SCOPE.sState('madrid_state').GetName] in a massive display organized by multiple [SCOPE.sCulture('castilian_culture').GetName] political organizations."
 dvg_spain.56.f: "The event energized their opposition as well, with many hecklers and counter-demonstrators arriving to denigrate the [SCOPE.sCulture('castilian_culture').GetNamePlural] and show their [SCOPE.sCulture('spanish_culture').GetName] patriotism. The resulting unrest and sensational news coverage has further invigorated the [SCOPE.sCulture('castilian_culture').GetName] cause, and many unitarians are now calling for a nationwide crackdown on the [SCOPE.sCulture('castilian_culture').GetName] nationalist movement to prevent it from growing out of control."
 dvg_spain.56.a: "What we need are events to rally [SCOPE.sCulture('spanish_culture').GetName] unity, not division."
 dvg_spain.56.b: "Yes, let’s curtail this radicalism at once!"
 dvg_spain.57.t: "Proliferation of Militias"
 dvg_spain.57.d: "Castilian nationalist organizations have existed in the east for some time now, but they have now moved from activism to preparing for armed struggle. Government agents in the east have documented not only Castilian independentists, but Asturian and Galician nationalists as well as community self-defense groups in the south, attempting to acquire weaponry and even uniforms for paramilitary groups. We have tried to disrupt them wherever possible, but the deteriorating state of law and order in eastern Spain has led to militias also appearing to “defend their communities.”"
 dvg_spain.57.f: "It is difficult to distinguish between those which are forming to enforce the law and those which are forming to resist the national government. Most of these groups are local in scope, while the larger ones compete with one another. If anybody managed to unify them, however, then they could pose an existential threat. The rise of these militias has cemented the feeling across Spain is that #red the point of no return has been passed. Civil war may now be inevitable…#!"
 dvg_spain.57.a: "They are mere criminals!"
 dvg_spain.58.t: "Massive Desertions in the Spanish Army"
 dvg_spain.58.d: "The consolidation of armed resistance and the spread of separatist sentiments has sundered the army along cultural lines. Many Castilian, Asturian, and Galician units of the Spanish Land Army have disintegrated for want of manpower. Soldiers have abandoned their posts in droves, either to fight for an insurrectionary movement pretending to be a nation, or simply to return home and protect their communities – or, for southerners, to finally take revenge against their landlords."
 dvg_spain.58.f: "While we might be able to draw back some of the latter type of deserters in the long term, for now our military is in total disarray and we will have to accept that we must fight for Spain with little organization or cohesion."
 dvg_spain.58.a: "Another cross to bear."
 dvg_spain.59.t: "Ill Omens"
 dvg_spain.59.d: "A mood of frightful tension has descended upon Spain. From the largest cities to even remote villages, there is a sense that all the old laws of political conduct and conflict are about to burst like a dam, to flood the nation with violence. Even the military is not safe from rumors."
 dvg_spain.59.f: "So far, only a handful of the most notorious separatist fanatics have deserted their posts, but many Castilian, Asturian, and Galician soldiers can be heard whispering or grumbling about the aspirations of their homeland, while southerners mutter darkly of their oppressive landlords. We will face the future with a sufficiently united armed forces, come what may…"
 dvg_spain.59.a: "…but not with a united soul."
 dvg_spain.60.t: "Formation of the Guarda Nacional"
 dvg_spain.60.d: "To uphold law and order as Spain slides into discord, we have formed an emergency paramilitary unit to assist local law enforcement. The Guarda Nacional will act to suppress separatist forces within our provinces, targeting anti-government militias. The Guarda Nacional will answer directly to the head of government and his cabinet, for the sake of efficiency, and will possess broad powers of investigation and internal autonomy."
 dvg_spain.60.f: "Some question if the establishment of this group may harm civil liberties but given the sheer scale of the national emergency many are just happy to know that the government is taking decisive action against the threat of sabotage, infiltration, and insurrection."
 dvg_spain.60.a: "May honor be their badge!"
 dvg_spain.61.t: "Proclamation of the Junta of Biscay"
 dvg_spain.61.d: "“We, the Cantabrian inheritors of the east, endured against the Moors when all the rest of Iberia was in darkness, and rallied the crusaders to drive out the Afro-Semites of the west in the name of God. Now we call upon our sons and daughters to once again defend our fatherland. For the sacred Cantabrian cause, Spain must perish!” – The Biscay Proclamation"
 dvg_spain.61.f: "The emergence of an eastern middle class of landowners and urbanites and an upper class of industrialists has fed nationalist myths of a “Cantabrian race” and more broadly petit-bourgeoisie reaction. Now Asturo-Basque general [SCOPE.sCharacter('atr_ruler').GetFullName] has led a clique of officers to seize the northeast, styling himself “Lord of Biscay” after the medieval Basque señorío and demanding the dissolution of the nation!

 dvg_spain.62.t: "Galicia Defects to the Junta of Biscay!"
 dvg_spain.62.d: "Galicia is often seen as a second Portugal, a copy of its southern counterpart. This may have been true last century, but no longer. Galician nationalists seeking to glorify Galician history and culture have harnessed the resentment which many Galicians feel towards Lisbon and the other prosperous cities of the southwestern coast, finding common cause with the separatist alliance in the northeast."
 dvg_spain.62.f: "Now a group of Galician officers have mutinied and seized the whole region in General Mascarenhas’ name! The traitors in Biscay have welcomed them with open arms and our control over northern Spain has well and truly collapsed."
 dvg_spain.62.a: "Você também, meu filho, sentirá o gosto do poder..."
 dvg_spain.63.t: "Galicia Declares Independence!"
 dvg_spain.63.d: "“Ours is an ancient land, old when Rome was born. Some have called us, ‘Little Portugal,’ but we are slaves of nobody! Galicia belongs only to herself. From us Portugal arose. Now it is Spain, overtaken by Portugal, from which we liberate ourselves.” -  The La Coruña Declaration"
 dvg_spain.63.f: "Galicia is often seen as a second Portugal, a copy of its southern counterpart. This may have been true last century, but no longer. Galician nationalists seeking to glorify Galician history and culture have harnessed the resentment which many Galicians feel towards Lisbon and the southwest. A group of Galician officers and politicians in La Coruña have now crowned local Count [SCOPE.sCharacter('gli_ruler').GetFullName] as Duke of Galicia!

 dvg_spain.64.d: "”For too many generations, we have been prisoners within our own homeland.

The hour of our freedom and dignity, and the death of servitude, is at hand.” – The Seville Proclamation"
 dvg_spain.64.f: "Southern Spain, especially Andalusia, has been plagued by land privatization forcing peasants and herders to pay exorbitant rents or work temporary jobs for the smallest wages imaginable. Now, rural “captains of the people'' have formed councils across the towns and villages of the south, backed by deserting soldiers turning their guns upon the hated landlords. They have been organized by charismatic farmer and horse trainer [SCOPE.sCharacter('anl_ruler').GetFullName], whose message of anti-monarchism and rural land reform has electrified the south."

 dvg_spain.65.f: "With chaos consuming the north, certain easterners within the Spanish army have decided to act. This morning a group of Castilian officers led by General Ruben Guerrero congregated in the city of Toledo, along with most of the units under their command. There they have formed a new military council and have ceased to refer to the Spanish nation in preference for the “Castilian nation.” Rumors abound as to their intentions, but Spanish liberals all agree that this is a catastrophic development which likely signals the end of democracy in Spain and the start of something different, dark, and brutal."

 dvg_spain.66.t: "The Second Toledo Junta"
 dvg_spain.66.d: "”In that sacred hour, so many years ago, a collection of honorable men came together to safeguard the rights of the people against both anarchy and despotism. Now, on that same hallowed ground, we shall make a new stand for our nation, our Castile.” – Pronouncement of the Second Toledo Junta"
 dvg_spain.66.f: "With chaos in the north, certain easterners within the Spanish army have decided to act. This morning a group of Castilian officers led by General Ruben Guerrero congregated in the city of Toledo, along with most of the units under their command. Emulating the efforts of another clique of officers years ago, they have formed a new military council and have made fiery speeches extolling Castilian nationalism. Rumors abound as to their next moves but Spanish liberals all agree that the sundering of Spain is imminent."

 dvg_spain.67.d: "“To the people of Castile and to all the peoples of the world. Justice and the rights of man, irrevocable foundations which sustain the historical, legal, and institutional traditions of Castile, are the basis of the foundation of the Castilian Republic. The Castilian nation, its language and culture, has a thousand years of history. For centuries, Castile has maintained and run its own institutions in complete self-governance…The founding of the Castilian Republic comes from the necessity to protect the freedom, culture, and honor of all the citizens of Castile and responds to the obstruction on the part of the Spanish State by exercising the right of the people to withdraw their consent from their government.” – Declaration of Castilian Independence"
 dvg_spain.67.f: "The worst fears of western Spain have been realized : the Toledo Junta has declared an independent Castilian republic. The Spanish administration is being driven out of the east and our nation will soon be shattered."
 dvg_spain.67.a: "No declaration has taken place, because that would be illegal!"
 dvg_spain.68.t: "The Fall of Madrid"
 dvg_spain.68.d: "The Toledo Junta wasted no time in besieging Madrid. The city’s defenders attempted to halt them, but many defected to the junta and resistance soon collapsed. The junta marched on the royal palace, but the king and the royal family had already escaped to Lisbon. Undaunted, General Guerrero declared himself the leader of the new Castilian provisional government, announcing that a council of Castilian politicians would soon be convened to lay the “nation’s” legal foundation."
 dvg_spain.68.f: "Bewilderment and outrage is the best description of western Spain’s reaction. Many who had previously disdained the monarchy have rallied to the national banner out of righteous indignation at this blatant coup, but perhaps this support has come too late. The Spanish government is crumbling."
 dvg_spain.68.a: "And the House of Lorena-Aviz is once again imperiled…"
 dvg_spain.69.t: "The Sundering of Spain"
 dvg_spain.69.d: "The collapse of the Spanish administration in the east has allowed the Castilian revolutionaries to consolidate their new government. Working with nationalist paramilitaries across the region, they have driven out Spanish bureaucrats and seized control of all the apparatuses and organs of government in the eastern provinces."
 dvg_spain.69.f: "An eerie feeling of imminent catastrophe has descended upon Spain, with rebel juntas assembling their forces for the struggle to come. The Moors must surely be cackling in their graves: just like the Cordoban caliphate which our ancient ancestors warred against, we too find ourselves shattered and divided."

 dvg_spain.70.d: "The first skirmishes with the Eastern traitors have already begun. Across Estremadura and the province of Salamanca, small but fierce battles have raged between Lisbon loyalists and the rebels seeking to engulf them into their insurrections."
 dvg_spain.70.f: "The lack of strong centralization in the region has played to our advantage as the common Estremaduran and Salamancan people have rejected the traitors’ pretense of “legitimate” grievances. We have forced them back out of central Spain and kept the area in loyal hands."
 dvg_spain.70.a: "The first of many victories to come!"
 dvg_spain.71.t: "The Loss of Central Spain"
 dvg_spain.71.d: "The first skirmishes with the Eastern traitors have already begun. Across Estremadura and the province of Salamanca, small but fierce battles have raged between Lisbon loyalists and rebels seeking to engulf them into their insurrections."
 dvg_spain.71.f: "Our efforts to impose strong centralization in the region has played to our enemies’ advantage - the common Estremaduran and Salamancan people have found sympathy with the traitors’ pretense of “legitimate” grievances. We have been forced out of central Spain and the area is now in enemy hands."
 dvg_spain.71.a: "Only a minor setback."
 dvg_spain.72.t: "Consolidating Castile"
 dvg_spain.72.d: "Now that we have seized our independence from the cruel Spaniards, we must organize our new nation. An emergency government has been formed to carry us through this time of crisis until we can establish peace. However, while we began as a republic, debate is raging between three internal factions about whether we should adopt a different form of government."
 dvg_spain.72.f: "The first comprise Castilian republicans who see the institution of monarchy as irreversibly corrupted by the decadent Lorena-Avizes and want a new, democratic order, sympathetic to the councils in the south. The second are Castilian traditionalists who demand a monarchy of our own, aiming to crown prominent Leonese-Castilian nobleman (and close friend of Guerrero) Buenaventura de Franco as King Buenaventura I. The third are Guerrero’s own loyalists who seek to enshrine the charismatic general as “caudillo” of Castile, sympathetic to the conservatives in the north. It soon becomes clear that…"

 dvg_spain.73.d: "With the republicans having fended off the challengers to our nascent democracy, it has been proposed to form a united front with the Junta of Seville. By far the most fanatically anti-monarchist clique in Iberia, we may be able to appeal to our shared values to induce them to join forces against Lisbon and Biscay."
 dvg_spain.73.f: "If we prevail in the struggle to come, such an alliance between the reformists of Andalusia and ourselves could serve as the foundation for a new, more vibrant and just nation. However if we receive no answer from them then we will be forced to fight them as well."

 dvg_spain.73.b: "We are no friend of crazed fanatics!"
 dvg_spain.74.t: "A Coalition with Biscay?"
 dvg_spain.74.d: "With the consolidation of Caudillo Guerrero’s government, it has been proposed to form a united front with the Junta of Biscay. Given that they are stridently opposed to the threats of liberalism and socialism, we may be able to appeal to our shared values to induce them to join forces against Lisbon and Seville."
 dvg_spain.74.f: "If we prevail in the struggle to come, such an alliance between the traditionalists of the north and ourselves could serve as the foundation for a stronger, bolder nation. However if we receive no answer from them then we will be forced to fight them as well."
 dvg_spain.74.a: "Make the offer."
 dvg_spain.74.b: "We are no friend of delusional brutes!"
 dvg_spain.75.t: "A Coalition with Toledo?"
 dvg_spain.75.d: "Castilian republicans have, unexpectedly, fended off the aspirations of monarchists and dictators to preserve their new democracy. Now they have extended an offer to form a united front against both the Spanish nationalists in Lisbon and the reactionaries in Biscay."
 dvg_spain.75.f: "While it would compromise the purity of our revolutionary vision, it would certainly increase our chances of survival, and give our people a considerable voice in the national future when our struggle is over."

 dvg_spain.75.b: "No, we will never serve another master again!"
 dvg_spain.76.t: "A Coalition with Toledo?"
 dvg_spain.76.d: "Castilian patriots have foiled republican schemes to usurp their movement and have preserved the true spirit of their nation. Now they have extended an offer to form a united front against both the Spanish nationalists in Lisbon and the radicals in Seville."
 dvg_spain.76.f: "While it would require us to alter and moderate our perspective, it would certainly increase our chances of survival, and give our people a considerable voice in the national future when our struggle is over."
 dvg_spain.76.a: "Yes, we shall be the axis upon which Iberia turns!"
 dvg_spain.76.b: "No, they are just as decadent as the Portuguese!"
 dvg_spain.77.t: "An Alliance with Seville?"
 dvg_spain.77.d: "The Eastern traitors have formed a Faustian pact with the Junta of Biscay and its crazed leader, Ruben Guerrero, feeding his delusions of “Cantabrianism” in a naked grab for power. Given the manner in which this has strengthened the rebel position, we may want to consider forming a coalition of our own with the Junta of Seville."
 dvg_spain.77.f: "Unlike Toledo or Biscay, they are not opposed to Spanish reunification, merely the political and economic conditions within Spain. Nevertheless, they do have rather radical views and we would be forced to assimilate some of this radicalism into our own ideology if we want to keep them loyal, but such a compromise could lay the foundation for a better Spain after our struggle is over."
 dvg_spain.77.a: "Make the offer."
 dvg_spain.77.b: "No, the Southerners are traitors too and they shall die like traitors!"
 dvg_spain.78.t: "A Coalition with Lisbon?"
 dvg_spain.78.d: "The esoteric reactionaries of Biscay have joined forces with the Castilians, threatening to overwhelm both Lisbon and ourselves. Now the Spanish government has requested to form a united front with our own movement! They have offered considerable political concessions, including full parliamentary democracy and land reform, if we agree to merge our forces back into their own."
 dvg_spain.78.f: "While many of our comrades are insistent that we cannot compromise our democratic vision, in the face of a stronger reactionary position in the north, we may not have any other choice."

Now the juntas are preparing to strike against the Spanish government as well as their own rivals, just as we are preparing to restore order to the nation. Soon enough, the sword of national disunion will be drawn, and rivers of blood shall run through Iberia."

 dvg_spain.80.f: "Ever since the end of the succession war between the liberal José II and the reactionary Pedro III in 1815, Spain has been torn between liberalism and conservatism. That old divide has now become a confrontation between the Spanish identity, situated in the old lands of Portugal, and the identities of outlying regions. At stake is not merely the unity of the nation, but questions of ideology, language, and religion. What is Spain, and who governs it? Is it a force of unity, or merely Portuguese oppression? New ideas of nationalism and separatism have entrenched themselves just as the armies of the juntas are now entrenching themselves on the battlefield and preparing for the most horrific chapter in Spanish history. And as the world watches, yet another question arises : is this merely a dark episode in the story of Europe, or a sign of things to come for all nations?"

 dvg_spain.85.d: "Through blood and fire, through brutality the likes of which Iberia has never seen before, Spain has finally prevailed in the civil war. As grieving families across the nation bury their dead, and the banners of the Castilians and the other juntas lie torn and discarded, we must now somehow become a nation again."

This “Statue of Autonomy” (or “new fueros” in the words of its detractors) has reorganized Spain into a collection of autonomous communities, each with their own legislatures and protections for their cultural and linguistic aspects. The Statue has also delineated the powers of the regional versus the national government, dividing their responsibilities, and finally establishes a national parliament with a ceremonial head of state."
 dvg_spain.86.f: "It is hoped that the Statue will allow the old system of the fueros to be superseded without trampling the cultural rights which caused so much bloodshed. The various cultures of Spain are grateful that we have not sought a victor’s peace with them, and separatism in the east has been dealt a tremendous blow. For the first time since 1808, Spain has been truly reunited."

 dvg_spain.87.d: "After days of intense debate, the leading jurists and politicians of Spain have emerged with a new legal framework to restore national stability. While certain cultural and linguistic rights have been conceded to the historical lands of Castile, the central status of Lisbon within the nation has been confirmed."
 dvg_spain.87.f: "The document has not brought forth any colossal changes in Spanish governance but given that the nation’s wounds will take many years to heal, perhaps we are not in need of colossal change right now. The peoples of the east mourn for their lost nation but have accepted the hope of building a more equitable Spain alongside the westerners. For the first time since 1808, Spain is at peace within."
 dvg_spain.87.a: "Uma Espanha, com liberdade e justiça para todos."
 dvg_spain.88.t: "O Decreto de Unificação"
 dvg_spain.88.d: "After days of intense debate, the leading jurists and politicians of Spain have emerged with a new legal framework to finally unify the nation. Given that the existence of separate codes throughout the country has proven to be the source of endless strife and division, it has been decided to do away with all of them. A standardized curriculum will be imposed upon all Spanish schools, and all government business will be required to be conducted in “Modern Spanish,” the codified, official language of the nation."
 dvg_spain.88.f: "Symbols of separatism will be forbidden from public display, and the status of Lisbon as the sole source of legal authority within the nation has been enshrined. Asturians, Basques, Castilians, and Galicians have all reacted with anguish at the news, but thankfully the Guarda Nacional will annihilate any surviving fragments of treasonous militias. For the first time since 1808, Spain has a plan to achieve unity."
 dvg_spain.88.a: "A Espanha, indivisa!"
 dvg_spain.89.t: "The End of the Civil War"
 dvg_spain.89.d: "Through blood and fire, through brutality the likes of which our people have never seen before, Castile has finally prevailed in the civil war. As grieving families across the nation bury their dead, we must now decide how we shall conclude a peace with the westerners. While most newspaper coverage has depicted all of Castile as being aflame with independentist sentiment, the reality is far more complex."
 dvg_spain.89.f: "Given that the Castilian economy would necessarily suffer if permanently decoupled from the west, many Castilian politicians have proposed that we force the westerners to reunify Spain on our terms. Therefore we have drafted an extremely decentralized constitution that would make Castile and the other regions of Spain practically independent and remake the feudal system in our image."
 dvg_spain.89.a: "Spain will be Castilian at last."
 dvg_spain.90.t: "A Castilian Spain"
 dvg_spain.90.d: "Our defeat in the civil war has left the country devastated, but the Castilians will give us no time to rest. Their representatives have arrived in Lisbon and have presented a new legal framework to reorganize Spain. The document castrates the authority of the national government, reserving vast amounts of power to the “states of the Spanish Confederation.” Each state may decide its own laws on language, religion, and criminal codes. The land rights of local elites and the Catholic Church have been confirmed, and even the national army has been divided along regional lines, with each state in charge of soldiers from its community."
 dvg_spain.90.f: "All major institutions of the government are to be relocated to the Castilian heartland, and the Castilian language is to be made the new official language of Spain. The unthinkable has occurred : Castile has become the master of Spain, and Portugal the subject, in the reborn neo-feudal order."
 dvg_spain.90.a: "¿Una España?"
 dvg_spain.91.t: "The End of the Civil War"
 dvg_spain.91.d: "Through blood and fire, through brutality the likes of which our people have never seen before, Castile has finally prevailed in the civil war. As grieving families across the nation bury their dead, Castile prepares to take its first steps onto the world stage as a free and independent nation. The brutal centralization espoused by the westerners over the years has radicalized many Castilians and attempts by moderates to propose reintegration under a highly decentralized system have foundered on the tidal wave of Castilian nationalism."
 dvg_spain.91.f: "In fact, nationalist and separatist sentiments are sweeping across western Iberia, and it seems as though Spain will soon cease to exist. We are not troubled, however – good riddance! May Castile’s future be one of peace, prosperity, unity, and most of all, no more Spaniards!"
 dvg_spain.91.a: "¡Ave Maria!"
 dvg_spain.92.t: "Victory!"
 dvg_spain.92.d: "In a turn of events which all but the true patriots united under Lord Guerrerro doubted, we have defeated the cowardly Spanish government and forced them to our righteous will! Now the time has come to bring an end to the decadent, rotten Spanish nation."
 dvg_spain.92.f: "There will be no “reforms,” no attempts to save what is so obviously damned. For Spain, there is only the lake of fire. And for the reborn Cantabrian people, there is only the bright and glowing promise of a future of further triumphs!"
 dvg_spain.92.a: "May Spain’s death be our regeneration!"
 dvg_spain.93.t: "The Dissolution of Spain"
 dvg_spain.93.d: "The end of the Spanish Civil War may have brought peace to western Iberia, but unity has remained elusive. The differences between the western coast and the rest of the country proved irreconcilable. With multiple juntas refusing to reintegrate back into the nation, Spain has lost most of its population at a stroke. Even the most fervent Spanish nationalists were forced to admit that the country could not continue to exist in such conditions."
 dvg_spain.93.f: "This morning the Spanish legislature convened for the final time in Lisbon and voted the nation of Spain out of existence, replacing it with a country which has not graced the maps of the world in centuries: Portugal. Former Spanish imperial possessions have been lost in the tumult, scooped up by foreign powers. A new day dawns over Iberia, one where the Spanish eagle is nowhere to be seen."
 dvg_spain.93.a: "Spain’s story may be over, but the story of her children is not."
 dvg_spain.94.t: "The End of the Civil War"
 dvg_spain.94.d: "Through blood and fire, through brutality the likes of which our people have never seen before, Castile has finally prevailed in the civil war. As grieving families across the nation bury their dead, we must now decide how we shall conclude a peace with the westerners. While most newspaper coverage has depicted all of Castile as being aflame with independentist sentiment, the reality is far more complex."
 dvg_spain.94.f: "Given that the Castilian economy would suffer if permanently decoupled from the west, many Castilian politicians have proposed that we force the westerners to reunify Spain on our terms. Therefore we have drafted a new constitution to enshrine parliamentary democracy as the foundation of Spain and establish a federal republic to defend minority rights. The time has come for our people to enter modernity!"
 dvg_spain.94.a: "Let us all bask in the light of the future!"
 dvg_spain.95.t: "Victory!"
 dvg_spain.95.d: "To the astonishment of all except the heroes of the people led by Raul Pinto, we have defeated the tyrannical Spanish government and forced it to listen to the will of its citizens! Now the time has come to fulfill the long-deferred dream of Spanish liberalism and create a new, radically free nation."
 dvg_spain.95.f: "No longer shall the lords of old and the proud cities of the west hold the lash over the common man! No longer shall we be made slaves and paupers upon our own soil! We defy those who said that Spain could only be an iron shackle upon another’s neck. By enshrining parliamentary democracy, freedom of the press, the right to unionize, and the ownership of the land by its people, we will bring to birth a new Spain from the ashes of the old."
 dvg_spain.95.a: "Together, we are strong!"
 dvg_spain.96.t: "The Federal Republic of Spain"
 dvg_spain.96.d: "Our defeat in the civil war has left us devastated, something recognized even by our foes. Their representatives have arrived in Lisbon and presented a new constitution to reorganize the nation. Full parliamentary democracy is to be implemented at once, along with a host of other social protections including freedom of speech, freedom of public assembly, and the right to unionize. Moreover, Spain itself is to become a federal republic, with each constituent state organizing its own codes along the federal model and with certain powers divided between the national and state legislatures."
 dvg_spain.96.f: "Any remaining members of the Lorena-Aviz dynasty have been permitted to go into exile on the condition of renouncing their claim to the Spanish throne. The liberal dreams of the old revolutionary societies like the Carmelistas have finally been realized." 
 dvg_spain.96.a: "A new Spain for a new era!"
 dvg_spain.97.t: "Collapse of the Popular Front"
 dvg_spain.97.d: "Our government is not officially Blanquist, but we have accepted many Blanquists and other leftists into the government for the sake of unity."
 dvg_spain.97.f: "Now, however, radical elements among the far-left, fueled by dissatisfaction in our conduct, have attempted to seek a way to coup our government."
 dvg_spain.97.a: "The Communists are defeated"
 dvg_spain.97.b: "The revolution is victorious"
 dvg_spain.98.t: "The Collapse of the Spanish Empire"
 dvg_spain.98.d: "Spain, the oldest and most steadfast ally of the Dual Monarchy, has ceased to exist. Following a civil war of unprecedented brutality and violence, the very concept of the Spanish nation was so thoroughly discredited that its component cultures dissolved it rather than see it reunite. Conservatives throughout the Dual Monarchy are horrified, and a few particularly eccentric reactionaries have been seen in public wearing funereal black to “mourn the death of Hispania.”"
 dvg_spain.98.f: "Nevertheless, as our government realigns itself to accommodate this new reality (and the copious refugees which have sought shelter within our nation), our colonial office has reminded us that it would be irresponsible to allow Spain’s former imperial possessions to collapse into anarchy. Due to our status as preeminent global maritime power, we have assumed Spain’s colonial burdens. Anglois soldiers have marched into formerly Spanish colonies and taken control of them for their own safety."
 dvg_spain.98.a: "Keep calm and carry on."
 dvg_spain.99.t: "The Collapse of the Spanish Empire"
 dvg_spain.99.d: "Spain, beacon of stability and civilizing power, has ceased to exist. Following a civil war of unprecedented brutality and violence, the very concept of the Spanish nation was so thoroughly discredited that its component cultures dissolved it rather than see it reunite. Conservatives throughout our nation are shocked, and a few particularly eccentric politicians or other noteworthies have been seen in public wearing funereal black to “mourn the death of Hispania.”"
 dvg_spain.99.f: "Nevertheless, as our government realigns itself to accommodate this new reality, our colonial office has reminded us that it would be irresponsible to allow Spain’s former imperial possessions to collapse into anarchy.

Our soldiers have marched into formerly Spanish colonies and taken control of them for their own safety."
 dvg_spain.99.a: "Keep calm and carry on."
 dvg_spain.100.t: "The End of our Servitude"
 dvg_spain.100.d: "It appears that Spain, our former overlord, has collapsed. Following a civil war of unprecedented brutality and violence, the very concept of the Spanish nation was so thoroughly discredited that its component cultures dissolved it rather than see it reunite."
 dvg_spain.100.f: "In the resulting chaos, its imperial possessions have slipped from its grasp. The old machinery of Spanish oppression has thus disintegrated within our nation, and we are now the masters of our own destiny."
 dvg_spain.100.a: "Free at last!"
 dvg_spain.101.t: "New Spain in Peril"
 dvg_spain.101.d: "Ever since our triumph in the South Arcadian Revolt, we have maintained our hegemony within New Spain by virtue of three things : our cultural grandeur, our economic vitality, and our military might. Now that all three of these no longer hold the respect of the world, our influence within New Spain is dropping to dangerous levels. Every day, the colonial office receives new reports of Revolt-era flags being found in New Spaniards’ possession, or treasonous pamphlets advocating independence being discovered."
 dvg_spain.101.f: "Small but passionate protests have begun to occur across New Spain, demanding increased autonomy or even independence. #red If we do not quickly recover the world’s esteem as a great nation then we may lose New Spain once more – permanently.#!"
 dvg_spain.101.a: "We will not falter!"
 dvg_spain.102.t: "Fim do Domínio"
 dvg_spain.102.d: "“Sancho! My armor!” – Last words of Dom Quixote"
 dvg_spain.102.f: "Spain may have destroyed the Colombian Alliance in battle, but their ideas have remained, fueled by the unconquerable memories of those who value liberty, democracy, and independence. The decline of Spanish power has created the perfect climate for separatism to once again arise amongst the populace. After weeks of demonstrations against continued Spanish rule, the Viceregal government has collapsed. The elderly Viceroy Velasco de Iturbide attempted to personally lead a cavalry charge against a crowd in Mexico City, only to die of a heart attack in the saddle. This plunged the colony into chaos, and a provisional government led by the popular General Manuel Diaz took power. Diaz wasted no time in declaring independence, cementing Spain’s total failure in the New World."
 dvg_spain.102.a: "And thus ends the tale of the Spanish Empire."
 dvg_spain.103.t: "A Era Dourada"
 dvg_spain.103.d: "For centuries, Spain has been wandering in the dark, trying to rediscover its path. Cervantes likened us to a senile nobleman, trapped in a bygone era while the world moved on. Yet just as the sun must rise and drive out the night, so our nation has arisen again to illuminate the world! But this time, we do not do so alone. We do so as a family, united with all our relatives. Cubans, New Granadans, Salvadorans, New Spaniards of both Mexico and Lusitania, and yes, even Castilians – all members of the Spanish dynasty."
 dvg_spain.103.f: "As the new Hispanic Cortes convenes for the first time, representatives from across Arcadia, Ameriga, and Europe are preparing to collectively shoulder the responsibility of governing our blessed people. The rising of the new day finds us not as a despot lording over their subjects, but as an everlasting and democratic union of kindred cultures, the Hispanic Commonwealth!"
 dvg_spain.103.a: "A commonwealth upon which the sun shall never again set!"
 dvg_spain.104.t: "The Prodigal Son Returns"
 dvg_spain.104.d: "The proclamation of the Hispanic Commonwealth has caused a remarkable transformation of the easterners. Now that they have finally been given a truly equal stake in the nation, many of them have abandoned their ferocious nationalism in favor of fighting for Castile’s rights within the Hispanic framework. While Castilian separatists shall unfortunately exist for the foreseeable future, the demands for an independent Castile have rapidly begun to disappear from the east."
 dvg_spain.104.f: "They have been replaced with a determination to safeguard the rights of their people while still supporting the Commonwealth’s endeavors and renewing their faith in our government. Castile, the prodigal son of Hispania, has returned to the fold at last."
 dvg_spain.104.a: "“Thy brother was dead, and is alive again: was lost, and is found.”"
 dvg_spain.105.t: "The New Granadan Dominion"
 dvg_spain.105.d: "The colonial government of New Granada has officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance."
 dvg_spain.105.f: "This will see the colony better able to protect itself without military support and considering their united stance it's entirely possible that should we refuse we will see renewed rebellion there."
 dvg_spain.105.a: "This can only be good for the empire."
 dvg_spain.105.b: "No, they shall remain under our direct control."
 dvg_spain.105.c: "Onwards to New Granada!"
 dvg_spain.106.t: "The Cuban Dominion"
 dvg_spain.106.d: "The colonial government of Cuba has officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance." 
 dvg_spain.106.f: "This will see the colony better able to protect itself without military support and considering their united stance it's entirely possible that should we refuse we will see renewed rebellion there."

 dvg_spain.107.t: "The Last Andine War"
 dvg_spain.107.d: "”To the north lies Andagoya, with its dishonour and poverty : to the south, a land to be discovered which promises both honour and wealth. He who is a good Castillian, let him make the right choice.” - Francisco de Pizarro" 
 dvg_spain.107.f: "Ever since we descended upon the Andes in the 16th century, our intent has laid in its conquest. Delayed time and time again by interference from powers conspiring with the barbarous lords of the Andes, it is now time to make our move. The last few centuries have seen nothing but victory after victory for the forces of the Spanish Crown, our superiority shining over the barbarians south of Fuerte Chancay - With a rocky succession wreaking havoc across the Empire of the Four Corners and the threat of the Beornians laying waste across their southern frontiers, the Inca now show their weakness to the entire continent, thus, it is time to march south from the Chancay line."
 dvg_spain.107.a: "We shall finish what Pizarro started!"
 dvg_spain.108.t: "An attack from the North"
 dvg_spain.108.d: "Using their colonial abomination of “Quito”, the Spanish Crown is dealing their last hand unto us: They intend to finish what Pizarro started, and failed miserably at doing over 300 years ago, the extermination of the Tawantinsuyu."
 dvg_spain.108.f: "While the last few centuries haven’t been kind to the sons and daughters of Inti and Wiraqucha, we remain steadfast - We will reconquer Chinchaysuyu and drive the barbaric plunderers from their lofty palaces in Quito!"
 dvg_spain.108.a: "Onwards, to war!"
 dvg_spain.109.t: "The End of the Incan Empire"
 dvg_spain.109.d: "By prevailing over all obstacles and distractions, one may unfailingly arrive at his chosen goal or destination - Cristóbal Andagoya"
 dvg_spain.109.f: "We promised our sons and daughters that we would lay siege to the barbarous hosts of the Inca, and we did. The savage hordes of the Incan Empire threatened to consume everything we had built and strived for since the eve of the Andes’ discovery in the 16th Century - yet they failed. With the destruction of Cuzco, boundaries are drawn, titles are distributed, encomiendas are allocated and the former heartlands of the Four Corners are summarily incorporated into the Viceroyalty of Quito." 
 dvg_spain.109.a: "Plus Ultra!" 
 dvg_spain.110.t: "The End of the Usurpers"
 dvg_spain.110.d: "He who deals death unto another without authority or a just cause, his own self he condemned to death. -Pacha Kutiq Inka Yupanki"
 dvg_spain.110.f: "Ever since the Spanish descended upon Intipmarka, the lands of the Sun, in the 16th century they embarked upon a quest of destruction and subjugation upon the inhabitants of these lands. Destroying everything in their wake and ripping whatever wealth these lands held, they time and time again attempted to render the Tawantinsuyu asunder, under pretences of wealth unending and glory. Trying to take advantage of our tumultuous succession, they plunged themselves unto our lands in hope of crushing us and achieving their ambitions - However, little did they know, they also plunged themselves unto death and slaughter. We have beaten back the combined forces of Quito and Spain, and with this, the era of Spanish rule over Intipmarka comes to an end!"
 dvg_spain.110.a: "Fortune favours the bold!"

 #Decisions
 integrate_granada: "Integrate New Granada"
 integrate_granada_desc: "If the Spanish Empire was a family, then New Granada would be one of the younger children, rowdy and successful but also difficult to control. While we have had some success cultivating a population of loyalists in the east, western New Granada has been a hotbed of unrest, being a vast and mountainous territory at the edge of the wild Amazon rainforest. The escapades of notorious warlords Guillermo de Blanco and Antonio Rocafuerte are proof that New Granada urgently requires attention to preserve law and order. Thus, we will create a New Granadan legislature, and introduce economic reforms to increase New Granadan trade as a condition of their integration. Combined with laws to safeguard their cultural traditions, we should be able to affirm New Granada’s status as a loyal part of the Spanish Empire."
 integrate_quito: "Integrate Quito"
 integrate_quito_desc: "If the Spanish Empire was a family, Quito would be the petulant and rebellious child who refused the warmth of her parents embrace and tried to refuse her heritage. Thankfully, the folly of youth has passed, and the Quitenese can now understand that their links with Spain are more important than the heathen cultures from their past. Advances in communication and transportation technology, have made their economic and cultural integration a success and finally they can join our glorious Mancomunidade!"
 integrate_cuba: "Integrate Cuba"
 integrate_cuba_desc: "If the Spanish Empire was a family, then Cuba would be the eldest child, perhaps not the most accomplished but certainly the most honorable and trustworthy. Long known as the “Ever Loyal Isle,” the island has seen considerable European migration, and there is little radical sentiment among Cubans. Cuban nationalism has still been rising, but there is time to prevent it from becoming uncontrollable. Advances in communication technology make it possible to create the first overseas legislature in Cuba, giving the Cubans local autonomy within the Spanish Empire without surrendering the influence of the metropole in their affairs. Combined with laws to safeguard their cultural traditions, we should be able to affirm Cuba’s status as a loyal part of the Spanish Empire."

 end_the_andine_wars: "End the Andine Wars"
 end_the_andine_wars_desc: "Since our discovery of the Andes in the 16th century, and the first failed attempts by conquistadors like the Blessed Francisco de Pizarro, the Spanish Crown has battled against the barbarous Inca Empire. Their so-called Empire proved resilient, and their alliance with the Protestant powers allowed them to resist Spanish might for a time. But now, as the Spanish colonies have been reconquered, it falls to Spain to end the Andine Wars and bring the word of God throughout the Andes."
 establish_mauretania: "Establish Mauretania"
 establish_mauretania_desc: "In modernity, Mauretania only survives as an ideal among many Spanish thinkers and in some titular sees. But it doesn’t have to be this way as our hold onto Morocco has been officialized. With some investment, we can establish the proper institutions and infrastructure to formalize Mauretania as an integral part of the Spanish state while removing the last vestiges of Mohammedan authority in the region…"
 weak_novo_sistema: "O Novo Sistema"
 weak_novo_sistema_desc: "As our society grows and advances, we have found that the old methods of social support are no longer adequate. There is a growing sentiment within Spain that the government must take a more active role in promoting social welfare, particularly that of children. This sentiment has now crystallized behind the movement to pass what is commonly referred to as the New Systems Bill. This measure would do two things : establish a free public school system with mandatory enrollment, and forbid the employment of any person below a certain age. It is hoped that this will reduce child mortality and grow our learned, literate populace."

 novo_sistema_desc: "As our society grows and advances, we have found that the old methods of social support are no longer adequate. There is a growing sentiment within Spain that the government must take a more active role in promoting social welfare. This sentiment has now crystallized behind the movement to pass what is commonly referred to as the New Systems Bill. The bill would encompass several of the most advocated social reforms, namely free public schools, a national health care organization, the end of child labor, and the implementation of formalized bankruptcy laws to end the practice of forcing debtors to work off their debts. It is hoped that this reform program will greatly improve the health and education of our society."
 integrate_navarra: "Integrate Navarra"
 integrate_navarra_desc: "The region of Navarre has laid at the crossroads of Spain, Aragon, and the Dual Monarchy for centuries. Through cunning political maneuvering, they have managed to play all three powers against one another and prevent the complete loss of their independence. However, our influence in the region is now so overwhelming that we may seriously consider attempting to merge Navarre into our own nation. Our legal scholars, by now well experienced in handling the demands of certain cultures, assure us that it would be a simple matter to design an internal autonomy arrangement to satisfy the Navarrese. Viva Navarra e Espanha!"
 integrate_catalan: "Integrate the Catalans"
 integrate_catalan_desc: "Now that Catalonia has become part of our nation, we should take steps to establish their proper place within it. They will be allowed to retain distinct elements of their culture and legal tradition, and by doing so will become acclimated to their status as a constituent part of our country. This integration within Spain will be the final step in establishing true pan-Iberianism and realizing the ancient dream of a unified Christian peninsula which has not existed since the rule of the Visigoths. Viva a Catalunha, Espanha e Ibéria!"

 protector_of_the_aragonese_CAS_desc: "Let us take over Catalonia to get closer to our goal to unify Iberia and reunify our Aragonese brothers under our wing!"
 integrate_salvadore: "Integrate San Salvador"
 integrate_salvadore_desc: "If the Spanish Empire were a family, then San Salvador would be the middle child, too often unnoticed and striving for its parents’ attention. An underdeveloped region defined by its radical separation between urban centers and outlying rural regions, San Salvador has struggled to attract enough migration and economic investment to reach the same levels of wealth as New Spain or New Granada. Advances in communication and transportation technology, however, may finally allow us to enmesh San Salvador’s rich lands with the international market. We will create a new Salvadoran legislature and introduce economic reforms to spur development. Combined with laws to safeguard their cultural traditions, we should be able to affirm San Salvador’s status as a loyal part of the Spanish Empire."
