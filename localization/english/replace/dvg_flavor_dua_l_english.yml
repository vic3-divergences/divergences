  dvg_dua.1.t: "The Anglois Dilemma"
  dvg_dua.1.d: "Ever since its formation via the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_rome] in 1498, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has had to walk a fine line in not favouring one of its ethnic groups over the others, always granting concessions and playing a delicate balancing game. Now, against the rising tides of Nationalism, our country stands at a crossroads."
  dvg_dua.1.f: "Recent censuses have shown that the English and French each represent around one-fifth of the population. What is more threatening to either of them is not one another, but rather a growing group calling themselves the [concept_dod_anglois]. Many in our government believe that embracing the Anglois identity is the only way to permanently stabilize the realm, though this is certain to result in widespread unrest. Others believe we should drop the balancing act altogether and simply become either a French or English nation-state, though whichever path we choose, its opposing culture is sure to be displeased."
  dvg_dua.1.a: "Favor the [SCOPE.sCulture('french_culture').GetName] language!"
  dvg_dua.1.b: "Favor the [SCOPE.sCulture('english_culture').GetName] language!"
  dvg_dua.1.c: "We are Kings of France and England! [SCOPE.sCulture('anglois_culture').GetName] is the future."
  dvg_dua.2.t: "The Anglo-French Monarchy"
  dvg_dua.2.d: "The Throne of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] has endured!"
  dvg_dua.2.f: "Despite the threat of radicals, nationalists and foreign power, our loyal citizens of the realm stand ready to serve their country, now one united nation! The coming decades will surely belong to the Anglois, for who can stand against the combined force of the Dual-Monarchy of France and England?"
  dvg_dua.2.a: "A new nation for a new era!"
  dvg_dua.4.t: "The French Monarchy"
  dvg_dua.4.d: "The Throne of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] has endured!"
  dvg_dua.4.f: "After the questions of the last years, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] has affirmed its French character. Now rooted in Paris, the Royal Court has gained the support of the French population and its leaders. This French orientation has allowed them to suppress any rebellion in the South but in the same time has alienated them a great part of the English population."
  dvg_dua.4.a: "Dieu sauve le roi!"
  dvg_dua.6.t: "The English Monarchy"
  dvg_dua.6.d: "The Throne of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] has endured!"
  dvg_dua.6.f: "Despite the troubles of the past years the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] has asserted its English roots. With London and Paris weighing the same in political matters and English being recognized as a national language, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] has secured the support of the Anglo population and its leaders. This English orientation has allowed them to suppress any rebellion in the North but in the same time has alienated them a great part of the French population."

  #Anglois Integration
  dvg_dua.101.t:0 "The Matter of the [SCOPE.sCulture('anglois_culture').GetName]"
  dvg_dua.101.d:0 "After being completely alienated in favor of a metropolitan minority, obtaining peace between the angry French and English mobs will not be an easy task."
  dvg_dua.101.f:0 "Our wise ruler. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], knows it very well. The [SCOPE.sCulture('french_culture').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCulture('english_culture').GetName] despise each other, but the only thing bigger than their hate against each other is their hate for Paris, and especially the [SCOPE.sCulture('anglois_culture').GetName], who for them, are a complete abomination. So if both of them were to rally against the new Anglois order, it would be disastrous. Trying times are head, our government must tread extremely carefully, for a full blown revolution by either of majority groups, would be completely disastrous for our nation and would most certainly spell our undoing."
  dvg_dua.101.a:0 "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will stand"
  dvg_dua.110.t:0 "Choosing a Patron"
  dvg_dua.110.d:0 "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has to choose an historical figure to honor in the coming months."
  dvg_dua.110.f:0 "Several proposals have emerged: Alfred the Great, the old Saxon king is admired by many across the Channel, Louis XI the Holy is seen as a benevolent figure here on the continent, Edouard IV was the first Plantagenet born in Paris and thus is seen as both a rallying figure for the Anglois but also a usurper for the French and a traitor for the English. No matter who the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] chooses to honour it will not please everyone."
  dvg_dua.110.a:0 "St-Louis is worthy of our recognition"
  dvg_dua.110.b:0 "Alfred the Great is worthy of our recognition"
  dvg_dua.110.c:0 "Edouard IV is worthy of our recognition"
  dvg_dua.111.t:0 "Histoire de la France depuis ses origines"
  dvg_dua.111.d:0 "The historian Pierre Guizot has published a new book upon the history of France."
  dvg_dua.111.f:0 "The book has received a warm response from French scholars for its exhaustivity. But its portrayal of English and early Plantagenets is quite troublesome and his idea of 'a distinct spirit existing since the Gauls' War' only amuses the French nationalists."
  dvg_dua.111.a:0 "He makes some interesting points"
  dvg_dua.111.b:0 "And he calls his book historic?"
  dvg_dua.112.t:0 "Saxon poetry"
  dvg_dua.112.d:0 "An anthology of English poetry has been published in Cambridge by the Sons of Harold."
  dvg_dua.112.f:0 "Regrouping old and new poets alike, this book has become widely applaused in England but many scholars from Paris consider it a complete waste of time."
  dvg_dua.112.a:0 "A truly wonderful piece of art!"
  dvg_dua.112.b:0 "As I said before, English is not fit for poetry."
  dvg_dua.113.t:0 "Travel of the Dauphin"
  dvg_dua.113.d:0 "The Travel of [SCOPE.sCharacter('travelling_heir').GetFullName] promises to be a grand and exciting event, full of pomp and ceremony."
  dvg_dua.113.f:0 "The young Dauphine of France and Princess of Wales is set to embark on a journey across the length and breadth of the kingdom, visiting its great cities, historic landmarks, and stunning natural landscapes. The trip will be marked by a series of lavish celebrations, including banquets, balls, and parades, as well as meetings with important dignitaries, influential artists, and leading intellectuals. Everywhere the Dauphine goes, she will be greeted by cheering crowds, who will wave flags and throw flowers in her path. From the bustling streets of Paris to the windswept cliffs of Brittany, this will be a journey to remember, and one that will cement the Dauphine's place as the future ruler of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
  dvg_dua.113.a:0 "This will be a journey to remember"
  dvg_dua.114.t:0 "Les Immortels"
  dvg_dua.114.d:0 "One of the Immortals seat is vacated."
  dvg_dua.114.f:0 "The Royal Academy, founded in the XVIIth century to host the greatest literary minds of the whole kingdom, has since evolved to codify the official language of the monarchy. One of the Immortals seats has been vacated, and we need to nominate someone. Although Tolsmith is a Saxon, he is recognized as one of the greatest philologists in the kingdom. In Occitania, the poet Jasmin has succeeded in captivating the minds of the court. However, the grammarian Morel could be nominated to demonstrate our desire for uniformity."
  dvg_dua.114.a:0 "Tolsmith could give us another perspective."
  dvg_dua.114.b:0 "The Occitan poet Jasmin is a good candidate"
  dvg_dua.114.c:0 "Nominate the proud Anglois grammarian Morel"
  dvg_dua.115.t:0 "Celebration of the German Revolution"
  dvg_dua.115.d:0 "Radicals in the Kingdom are preparing for the 55th anniversary of the First German Revolution."
  dvg_dua.115.f:0 "Some advisors have talked about allowing them to do so to better control them but if we do so then it will cost us our relations with the Bohemian court... Forbidding them to commemorate and organizing great ceremonies remembering the prowess of our armies during the ensuing wars would certainly be a good symbol of unity."
  dvg_dua.115.a:0 "If it can please these liberals."
  dvg_dua.115.b:0 "We won't associate with these monsters!"
  dvg_dua.116.t:0 "The Dual Springtime"
  dvg_dua.116.d:0 "The "Springtime of Nations" threatens to upon our delicate balance."

Thus, the new provisional cabinet in Londres declared that the Anglois destiny shall be realized in Britannie and that advances towards a reclamation of Paris shall cease, at least for now."
