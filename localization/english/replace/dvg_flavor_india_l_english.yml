 mughal.1.t:0 "On the Cusp of Death"
 mughal.1.d:0 "The Padishah is on death's door - not unexpected, as he has been bedridden for the last year or so. His sons circle like vultures, waiting for his death to put into action their own plans to ascend the masnad."
 mughal.1.f:0 "'Irony? What Irony?! If not that the seed of destruction carried in the heart of one brother was sowed and reaped to the full by the hand of another!' - Bhratrighatak, Mirza Asad.\n\n"'What do you think will happen when old Salaf dies?'\n'They're going to try to kill each other, like sons of the Padishah have always done.'\n'But what if the Europeans -'\n'Pfft. What will the firangi do?'"
 mughal.1.a:0 "O Allah, let us pass through these turbulent times unscathed!"
 salaf_tt:0 "On his passing, the Padishah will nominate a successor - but following the time-honoured Mughal tradition of internecine war, the other will not take it lying down."
 mughal.2.t:0 "The Padishah is Dead!"
 mughal.2.d:0 "The Padishah lies on his deathbed - it's just a matter of time now. He is accompanied by a trusted servant who will declare his wasiya upon his death."
 mughal.2.f:0 "'My lords, He is no longer with us.'\nNasiruddin leaps to his feet, leaving his European time piece on an end table,'What did that old bastard say?'\n'Brother!' says Qutbuddin, and they scowl at each other.\n\n'His last words were - 'I hope those fools go to hell -''\n'What, afraid of being alone?' Nasiruddin sneers.\n' - but he also decreed that his successor will be...'"
 mughal.2.a:0 "...his son, [SCOPE.sCharacter('qutb_scope').GetFullName]! "
 mughal.2.b:0 "...his son, [SCOPE.sCharacter('nasir_scope').GetFullName]!"
 mughal.3.t:0 "The Hazaarjagiri Rebellion"
 mughal.3.d:0 "Escaping his confinement in Delhi, [SCOPE.sCountry('mughal_rebellion_scope').GetRuler.GetFirstName] has fled to Allahabad Subah and has declared himself the true Padishah! Supporting him are the disgruntled zamindars and talukdars of the east, unhappy with the high taxes and Imperial control. We must crush this rebellion soon, or the consequences will be dire."
 mughal.3.f:0 "'As soon as we learned that it has pleased Almighty God to raise Your Royal Majesty to succeed to the throne of that great and mighty kingdom in the place of Your Majesty’s late father King Salafuddin, not only is our heart overcome with joy, but we have also deemed it to be our binding duty to approach bringing most not only the most respectful greetings to Your Royal Majesty but also the news that [SCOPE.sCountry('mughal_rebellion_scope').GetRuler.GetFirstNameNoFormatting], having escaped the guards you placed on him (which is known by you), has escaped to Allahabad by means of bovine conveyance and has begun gathering followers from Awadh, Allahabad and Bihar, many among them being your very own zamindars...'\n- Letter from the Subedar of Allahabad before his overthrow by [SCOPE.sCountry('mughal_rebellion_scope').GetRuler.GetFullNameNoFormatting]."
 mughal.3.a:0 "He will be felled like the traitorous dog he is."
 mughal.4.t:0 "Gone with the Wind"
 mughal.4.d:0 "The traitorous Subedar of Gujarat and the Rajas of Rajputana have forsworn their allegiance to the Empire at the first whiff of weakness! After we get our affairs in order, we will ensure their independence will be naught but a faint memory - but for now, we have more important matters to attend to; namely, suppressing the Hazaari rebels."
 mughal.4.f:0 "Be magnanimous, but if your magnanimity is taken for weakness, be decisive. A powerful clan of Uzbegs who did not let the ever-vernal flower of union and cordiality bloom was pardoned twice by us. Still, they would not cleanse the fountains of disagreement and the third time, committed the treasonable act of proclaiming Mirza Nasiruddin, our brother, as their king. We had them trampled to death.\n\nSo too shall the Rajputs and Gujaratis kneel or be destroyed."
 mughal.4.b:0 "Enough is enough - the rebel scum must die!"
 mughal.5.t:0 "The Grand Trunk Road to the Deep South"
 mughal.5.d:0 "Foreign residents and dignitaries have started departing in droves from the Empire, frightened by what they describe as 'a sudden and violent upheaval in law and order.' Unfortunately this means neither us nor our treasonous brother are recognised by the world as the real heir."
 mughal.5.f:0 "'...and in my conversation with the factory's Chief, a seasoned and elderly gentleman well-versed in the affairs of the Orient, I inquired about the purpose behind relocating all our goods and such for what appeared to be an enduring transfer, an action which would make our return tough, for the increased weight renders our asses and the primitive cow-driven carts of the Moguls slow and snail-paced. I posed this query to the Chief, who, with a solemn countenance, gazed at me and said, 'We'ren't coming back anytime soon.'\n- Memoirs of a German Doctor in the Burgundian Orient, 1867."
 mughal.5.a:0 "We must simply hope they return after the rebels are crushed."
 mughal.6.t:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] Triumphant"
 mughal.6.d:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] has defeated his perfidious brother, having him executed by elephant near the ruins of the Old Capital at Fatehpur Sikri, putting an end to nearly a year of instability and rebellion."
 mughal.6.f:0 "'The wise and far-sighted man is aware that in every period it is indispensable that there be a ruler who shall be strengthened by God's help and made fortunate by eternal blessings. And the philosopher perceives that such a power must be spiritual as well as possessed of strength of arm. The man of experience knows that many years must elapse before a ruby develops in the embryonic sac of the mine and arrive at maturity so as to be fit for a royal diadem. How many revolutions of epochs then, and how many cycles, are required bofore such a priceless pearl and unique jewel, lacking in naught can obtain his special preparation, so that by ascending steps, he arrives at the fullness of perfection? Allah be praised, none, for such a ruler has ascended the throne!' - [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstNameNoFormatting]nama by Mirza Azam Khan."
 mughal.6.a:0 "We must rebuild; but for now - let us rejoice!"
 mughal.6.b:0 "We must rebuild; but for now - let us rejoice!"
