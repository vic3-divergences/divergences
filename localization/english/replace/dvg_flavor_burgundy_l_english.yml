 je_rhine_burgundy: "Watch on the Rhine"
 je_rhine_burgundy_reason: "Ever since her victory over the German Revolutionaries and Catholics, Burgundy has held hegemony over the lands surrounding the Rhine. However, as nationalist sentiments rise, Burgundy risks losing it if the Rheinish are not effectively integrated."

 dvg_burgundy.1.t: "The Twentieth Year of Mourning"
 dvg_burgundy.1.d: "This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the death of Jean-Maximilien de Julich, late husband to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullNameWithTitle]. Since then, her heir [ROOT.GetCountry.GetHeir.GetFirstName] has grown more active in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] politics."
 dvg_burgundy.1.f: "Betrothed early to ensure the stability of the principality of Jülich within the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] kingdom, their marriage was a happy one (a rare occurrence in royal families). Four sons were born of their union between 1810 and 1817: [ROOT.GetCountry.GetHeir.GetFullName], Charles-Joseph de Frise, Maximilien de Nevers, and Philippe de Flandre. \n\n Alas, the king consort died while taking part in the Battle of Cassel during the War of the Fourth Coalition against [concept_dvg_wenceslaus] of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BOH').GetName]. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has worn the black of mourning ever since, and her political role has plummeted, with most of the royal duties taken by Parliament in her absence. While her father Joseph II still formed his own government [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] prefers to pray and lead a reclusive life, granting more and more powers to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetHeir.GetFirstName], now a regent in all but name."
 dvg_burgundy.1.a: "Our thoughts and prayers with the Consort."

 dvg_burgundy.2.t: "Election of the Archbishop of Cologne"
 dvg_burgundy.2.d: "The tacit accord between the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_PAP').GetName] and Anvers has been for decades that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective]s would not intervene in the elections of the archbishoprics in exchange for rewarding loyal and quiet clergymen instead of politicians in Cologne and Mayence. However, the latest archbishop elected has been concerning to the  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] nobility."
 dvg_burgundy.2.f: "The election of the latest Primate of Germany had seen for example Karl von Wittelsbach-Zweibrücken elected a conservative nobleman who pose no threat to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] rule. But in Cologne the Pope has recognized the election of  [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_archbishop').GetFullName] as archbishop. A popular figure in the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetName] he had taken part in his youth in the Frankfurt assembly before leaving it when they infringed on the rights of the Church. Escaping to the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetName] he has formed countless charities while preserving some of the spirit of the German revolution notably in his sermon of accession in which he has praised the Constitution of the Duchy of the Rhine and Liberal ideas..."
 dvg_burgundy.2.a: "We will watch him."

 dvg_burgundy.3.t: "Religious awakening in the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetName]"
 dvg_burgundy.3.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetName] has always been a Catholic bastion that the Reformation could not take down. With the recent increase in nationalist and liberal sentiments, there is a growing rift between the government of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and its Rheinish subjects."
 dvg_burgundy.3.f: "When Philippe I of  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] broke with Rome in 1530 the Emperor formally protected the archbishops of the Rhine members of the  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] circle and this status quo endured with Catholic tolerated and their rights confirmed by the Charter of the Duchy of the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetName]. Now countless preachers formed in the Cologne seminary and sponsored by Von Elnere roam the countryside reinforcing the Catholic faith and converting hundreds of indecisive Protestants. The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetName] is filled with religious fervour and in the most devout circles criticism of the religion of their legitimate sovereign has begun."
 dvg_burgundy.3.a: "Would the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetAdjective] stop already ?"

 dvg_burgundy.4.t: "Growth of Rhenish Pan-German Nationalism"
 dvg_burgundy.4.d: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetAdjective] Germans have not forgotten that when they were in the deadly grip of the Hollowing [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] did not commit to saving them."
 dvg_burgundy.4.f: "For a time German nationalism had been submerged amongst the peoples of the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetName] in favor of religious and economic tensions amongst themselves. Now however a new generation of German nationalists are coming to the fore across the Rhenish confederation those whose lost parents and grandparents in the Hollowing. In coffee shops and universities in markets and factories there are whispers in the dark against [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and her presence in the Rhine. Above all is a commitment to the Rhine’s German character and to upholding that quality against any attempt to erode it."
 dvg_burgundy.4.a: "Ominous."
 
 dvg_burgundy.5.t: "The Council of the Rhine in Cologne"
 dvg_burgundy.5.d: "German nationalism within the Rhenish lands continues to grow and now its supporters have begun to organize together."
 dvg_burgundy.5.f: "The Council of the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetName] inspired by the German Councils organized by the Danubians has recently concluded in the city of Cologne. This meeting drew pan-German nationalists from both the left and right banks of the Rhine with unprecedented cooperation between Catholics and Protestants. The Council’s resolutions stressed the need for Protestant and Catholic Rhenish Germans to join forces and avoid the sectarian divisions of the past and declared the “eternal and undiminished German nature of the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetName] and its people.” This event has greatly alarmed our foreign office as rallying support from Rhenish Protestants against the Catholics has been the foundation of our eastern policy. It is now possible that the whole Rhenish union could turn against us if we ever find ourselves at war with a pan-German government."
 dvg_burgundy.5.a: "This is a gross insult!"

 dvg_burgundy.6.t: "The 1000th Anniversary of the Treaties of Verdun"
 dvg_burgundy.6.d: "The Crown Prince [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_jean').GetFirstName] has made a remarkable visit to Verdun at the occasion of the 1000th anniversary of the treaty that saw the Carolingian empire split between the three sons of Louis the Pious. However, his words during the visit has fed into the alienation of the Catholic church and its followers."
 dvg_burgundy.6.f: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_jean').GetFirstName], a conservative and jingoist character has cultivated for years a 'link' to Lothar  the kings of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] seeing themselves as his heirs since the inception of the Kingdom. Among the various platitudes and strange comparisons that his speech included one has caught the ears of Rhenish journalists : 'like in the days of Lothar we now see men of the Church conspire to break down the state. As Hincmar advised Charles the Bald we now see traitorous talks in the Catholic clergy hoping to separate the lands of the Rhine from their rightful sovereign. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will not suffer the fate of the kingdom of Lothar and this beautiful and mighty country shall stand once again united and strong'. These words caused an uproar in the Duchy of the Rhine but the Prince refused to renege on his words."
 dvg_burgundy.6.a: "Who cares what the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetAdjective] papists think?"

 dvg_burgundy.7.t: "The Union Bill"
 dvg_burgundy.7.d: "The personal union of the Duchy of the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetName] has caused problems for years."
 dvg_burgundy.7.f: "Many Nederlander capitalists fear to invest in this industrial land because of the fact that the local government could change legislation or raise new taxes a right they were granted with the formation of the Duchy. Furthermore conservative circles fear that agitators are given too much freedom there and the military wants to have direct control over the Rhine fortifications the first line of defence of the Kingdom being shared with Rhenish troops that are widely distrusted by the General staff. There is thus a general will to act on the matter with a draft of a Union Act that would see the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetAdjective] people given the same rights as the rest of the people of the Kingdom with special articles protecting the Catholic faith while also ending the temporal powers of the high clergy. Some are calling for "One Kingdom on the Left Bank!""
 dvg_burgundy.7.a: "A kingdom that isn't united won't stand for long."
 dvg_burgundy.7.b: "Those problems will be worse if we try to do something."

 dvg_burgundy.8.t: "Failure of the Act of Union"
 dvg_burgundy.8.d: "As could be predicted [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetAdjective] opposition was stiff towards the  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] bill. The Aachen assembly has vetoed the proposition while the archbishop of Cologne has decided to refuse any acts that would endanger the Rhenish situation and way of life."
 dvg_burgundy.8.f: "The Anvers Parliament could have forced the Bill but they would have needed the assent of the sovereign for this. Anne then refused to intervene fearing a new German revolt could threaten again the Kingdom and reassured the Rhenish angering many Parliamentarians and also her own heir who had expressed his support for the bill"
 dvg_burgundy.8.a: "Best to not upset the course of things "

 dvg_burgundy.9.t: "Success of the Act of Union"
 dvg_burgundy.9.d: "The Anvers Parliament has forced the bill through with the unexpected assent of the sovereign."
 dvg_burgundy.9.f: "As could be predicted [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetAdjective]  opposition was stiff towards the  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] bill. The Aachen assembly has tried to veto the proposition while the archbishop of Cologne has decided to refuse any acts that would endanger the Rhenish situation and way of life. Yet, critics have acknowledged fearing a new German revolt could threaten again the Kingdom, but supporters have reassured the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetAdjective]  this will improve their standard of living in the long term and also her own heir who had expressed his support for the bill. "
 dvg_burgundy.9.a: "Great progress in the course of things "

 dvg_burgundy.10.t: "The Meeting of Cologne"
 dvg_burgundy.10.d: "Rumors have come from Cologne that Von Elnere would have met with the Revolutionary leader Hanno Tauber"
 dvg_burgundy.10.f: "Heir of the German revolutionaries the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] state has suspected him of animating various conspiracies and liberal associations throughout the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetName] but so far nothing conclusive has ever been uncovered. If this meeting has happened this could mean a lot for the political situation in the Duchy as both the Archbishops and Tauber could mobilize revolutionaries to free the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetName]"
 dvg_burgundy.10.a: "We must watch the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetName] even closer!"

 dvg_burgundy.11.t: "The Rhineland Revolt"
 dvg_burgundy.11.d: "The worst fears of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] government have come true: the Archbishop of Cologne has rallied the Duchy of the Rhine to revolt against the Queen in the hopes of forming an independent German liberal state."
 dvg_burgundy.11.f: "The failure of the Act of Union far from calming them only emboldened their opponents in the duchy who have grown in strenght with the Springtime of Nations. From the devout Catholics of the countryside to the revolutionary brotherhood of Hanno Tauber and the German nationalists all have rallied around the banner of the Archbishop calling for the end of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] imperialism."
 dvg_burgundy.11.a: "Mobilize our troops! We can't lose the Left Bank!"
 dvg_burgundy.11.b: "The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetName] Stands Against [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]!"


 dvg_burgundy.12.t: "A Confederation of the Rhine?"
 dvg_burgundy.12.d: "After the treaty that defeated the previous German Revolution was completed and left the land partitioned, a new rise in nationalist sentiment is bringing together Germans together against common enemies."
 dvg_burgundy.12.f: ""
 dvg_burgundy.12.a: "We do not need more participants in this conflict."
 dvg_burgundy.12.b: "We will need all the help we can get!"

 dvg_burgundy.13.t: "Join the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_RHI').GetName] Revolt?"
 dvg_burgundy.13.d: "Following an increase tensions in Burgundy, the Rhinelanders have revolted against the power nation that is Burgundy."
 dvg_burgundy.13.f: "Already there are rallies right outside our capitol with people yelling "Freiheit und Brüderlichkeit!", asking we join our bretheren in the revolt."
 dvg_burgundy.13.a: "We shall cry "Freiheit und Brüderlichkeit!" as well"
 dvg_burgundy.13.b: "The previous German Revolution failed, and this one probably will too."


 dvg_burgundy.14.t: "Burgundians are coming"
 dvg_burgundy.14.d: "We have revolted for freedom and catholicism against Burgundy!"
 dvg_burgundy.14.f: "Let us rally the good folk of the Rhine around the holy banner of Cologne and cast the Burgundians out!"
 dvg_burgundy.14.a: "Freiheit und Brüderlichkeit!"

 dvg_burgundy.15.t: "Rhineland Resurgent"
 dvg_burgundy.15.d: "Despite the industrial and militlary might of Burgunndy, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has managed to achieve independence. "
 dvg_burgundy.15.f: "Already, this has become interest of the great powers of Europe. What will become of the rest of the states along the Rhine? The rest of Germany? "
 dvg_burgundy.15.a: "We only wanted independence."
 dvg_burgundy.15.b: "We will spread our revolution through the rest of the Rhine."
 dvg_burgundy.15.c: "Germany will one day be united under Germans."



 dvg_burgundy.16.t: "The Rhineland Reconquest"
 dvg_burgundy.16.d: "The government of the Duchy of the Rhine has broken the Personal Union with the Burgundian kingdom and the Archbishop of Cologne has taken advantage of this to rally the Rhenish people under his rulegranting a liberal constitution and encouraging revolutions in Germany."
 dvg_burgundy.16.f: "This has prompted the Burgundians to mobilize their men to retake what they consider their rightful lands!"
 dvg_burgundy.16.a: "The Left Bank is ours!"

 dvg_burgundy.17.t: "The Act of Union"
 dvg_burgundy.17.d: "The end of the Duchy of the Rhine allowed the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] parliament to eventually pass the Act of Union"
 dvg_burgundy.17.f: "The various privileges especially the ones related to the two archbishoprics were removed and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] police confiscated weapons all across the reoccupied lands. However the act also granted equal representation and voting rights to the people of Rhénanie along with a general amnesty for the revolutionaries that had taken arms at the exception of the archbishop von Elnere who died in exile several years later. The act also saw the reaffirmation of the anti-slavery stance of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] kingdom and many Liberals saw it as the proof of the transition to a truly Liberal and Constitutional Monarchy."
 dvg_burgundy.17.a: "One Kingdom, One Law!"
 
 dvg_burgundy.18.t: "The Anvers Revolution"
 dvg_burgundy.18.d: "In order to accomodate the demands of the liberals, a new resolution was adopted in the country's capital city."
 dvg_burgundy.18.f: "In her many years of service Queen [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]’s contributions to the history of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] were already destined to be remembered in the future. But today she signed a new and unprecedented constitution into law across the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] lands: The overwhelmingly strengthened liberal faction of the Parliament has coerced the queen under the threat of “other means” to enshrine universal voting and the end of the slave trade across the realm among other such radical reforms which angered the political heir-apparent and Duke of Brabant [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_jean').GetFirstName] beyond reason. In a haphazardly written manifesto he decried the nerve to pressure his grieving and sick mother into enforcing such ridiculous demands which threaten to tear apart the fabric of the proud Burgundian society. Unsurprisingly this too caused outrage among the liberals as a politically active soon-to-be monarch is indeed a dire threat to their cause."
 dvg_burgundy.18.a: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_jean').GetFirstName] de Brabant is a problem."

 dvg_burgundy.19.t: "The Death of the Queen"
 dvg_burgundy.19.d: "The queen of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Anne II of Cleves-Valois-Bourgogne has died yesterday in her country mansion in Eupen. A devout and retired monarch she was seen as a figure of unity by the population although not many truly loved her"
 dvg_burgundy.19.f: "As the funerary convoy passed through the cities of Central [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to be buried in Anvers with her late husband many noticed that it was her last son Philippe of Flanders that led the procession rather than her heir Jean. It was no secret that tensions and divisions marked the royal family as the Queen resented the affirmed and oppposite personnalities of both the Reactionary heir and her Liberal second son."
 dvg_burgundy.19.a: "At least she joins her beloved in their mausoleum!"

 dvg_burgundy.20.t: "The Coronation of Jean VI"
 dvg_burgundy.20.d: ""
 dvg_burgundy.20.f: "A few days after the official funeral of the late Queen, Anvers was preparing for the new coronation of the King. As the ritual dictates the King enters Saint Michael's Abbey where the Archbishop of Anvers demands him an oath to protect the Realm the Faith and cause Justice for his subjects. Following this the King is annointed like the Kings of Israël. From this coronation emerged [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] VI of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] acclaimed by the crowds of Anvers. Foreign journalists witnessed some opposition to this joyous occasion notably from Liberal students that were however soon disposed by the police before being able to disturb the procession."
 dvg_burgundy.20.a: "Dei Gratia Rex"

 dvg_burgundy.21.t: "The Address to Parliament"
 dvg_burgundy.21.d: "The Sovereign of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] opens and closes Parliament and even the late Queen Anne did her duty although always following the advice of her Prime Minister."
 dvg_burgundy.21.f: "Jean VI however had a different mind on the royal function. As the members of the two Houses gathered to hear his speech he proclaimed that he had sworn to protect the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and that he would take a more important role in politics compared to his mother. His will was not to infringe on the rights bestowed to his subjects by his predecessors but only to exert his rights and duties as King of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. While the members of Parliament applauded the speech as the custom dictated the malaise felt by many was apparent."
 dvg_burgundy.21.a: "What does it mean for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]?"

 dvg_burgundy.22.t: "The Pinto Affair"
 dvg_burgundy.22.d: "The end of the Duchy of the Rhine allowed the Burgundian parliament to eventually pass the Act of Union"
 dvg_burgundy.22.f: "François de Pinto was a member of the East Indies Company who was in charge of lobbying members of Parliament in favor of the company. This year, he became the centre of a mediatic affair as corruption of members of Parliament was revealed by the Conservative newspaper 'Le Temps'. This was a blow to the Liberals since most of the members that had received bribes through da Pinto were of their faction and the number of laws protecting the interests of the Nederlander-based company provoked popular discontent throughout the Southern lands of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. As the son of a converted Jew, De Pinto was a perfect target for the newspaper and was soon forced to flee [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] because of the many threats he received"
 dvg_burgundy.22.a: "The V.O.C must be reigned in!"
 dvg_burgundy.22.b: "We should do more to accomodate the V.O.C instead."


 dvg_burgundy.23.t: "The Anti-Corruption Bill"
 dvg_burgundy.23.d: "Following the Pinto Affair, Conservative members of the Upper House proposed a bill that aimed to reduce the lobbying towards members of Parliament."
 dvg_burgundy.23.f: "This move was not a disinterested one : the Upper House was filled with nobles who had ties to the industries and foreign trade but never were lobbied like the Member of the Lower House. It was soon clear to many that the law while proposed by the Upper House had been drafted by the King who intented to play a role in politics. Even though the popular opinion was overwhelmingly in favor of the bill. The lower house rejected it declaring that current laws were sufficient to prevent another Pinto affair"
 dvg_burgundy.23.a: "What is this masquerade ?"

 dvg_burgundy.24.t: "The King's Speech"
 dvg_burgundy.24.d: "After the failure of the anti-corruption bill the King proposed a new bill on the subject with himself entering parliament to give a speech on it, in which he declares the dissolution of parliament."
 dvg_burgundy.24.f: " "It has become clear over the past couple of months that nobody in this entire institute that claims to represent the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people actually represents them. This Chamber houses nothing but the representatives of the interests of [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('industrialists_ig').GetName], merchants of money and the destructive forces of modernism. If no single man here is willing to defend the common people of this kingdom from these interests as you were willing to show again with the vote of this afternoon duty falls upon the oldest institute of our kingdom to do what this chamber has failed to do. Is it not the institute of king that bound by blood and rooted in our soil represents our nation's past as her tradition our nation's present as her voice and our nation's future as her hope ? It is because of this weight on my shoulders that I have decided to in my due right as king to dissolve the current session of Parliament until new elections have been called and a new parliament can take place in this chamber. Gentlemen you're free to go home."  "
 dvg_burgundy.24.a: "Is this the beginning of the crisis?"

 dvg_burgundy.25.t: "The State Language Act"
 dvg_burgundy.25.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has been a pluricultural state for centuries with Nederlander and German accepted in their territories while the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] language this hybrid Oil language codified by the Royal Academy from Bourguignon, Walton, Lorrain, and countless Nederlander and Flemish influences was always the primary language of the state."
 dvg_burgundy.25.f: "Now in these times of uncertainties Germanophobia is again a powerful force in politics and a group of moderates (deputies who are not in the Royal or Parliamentarian faction) have pushed for a unified language act that would abolish the teaching and the use of German Nederlander and Frisian in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] public institutions. While it has the support of the majority of the House whose members speak the purest [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] form of Anvers it could rekindle the fires of revolt in Rhineland. A radical faction has even proposed not to repel this act and maintain the status quo but to use this law to grant more language autonomy to the Germanic regions as to ensure their loyalty."
 dvg_burgundy.25.a: "Un Royaume une langue!"
 dvg_burgundy.25.b: "We can adopt their language as co-official."
 dvg_burgundy.25.c: "Let's split our kingdom into autonomous regions based on language."
 dvg_burgundy.25.e: "How about we keep the status quo instead?"

 dvg_burgundy.26.t: "The trial of Johan von Bosse"
 dvg_burgundy.26.d: "In the Pinto affair one deputy was largely attacked the self-proclaimed Republican Johan van Bosse."
 dvg_burgundy.26.f: "A controversial figure in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] throughout the years he only avoided conviction by royal authorities because of his elections to the Chamber and the large popular support he enjoys in Bruges. But the various bribes he took from the V.O.C has eroded his position and he lost his seat in the latest election. Now he faces a trial that is very much piloted by the Monarchy as the judge is a renowned Jeannist partisan. What will happen to the Republican of Bruges ?"
 dvg_burgundy.26.a: "He shall be freed."
 dvg_burgundy.26.b: "He shall be convicted."


 dvg_burgundy.27.t: "The death of Philippe Rickwaert"
 dvg_burgundy.27.d: "For months the duke of Ligny Saint-Pol a close friend from King Jean had threatened journalists from the radical newspaper 'Le libre Luxembourgeois' to stop attacking the king. One of those journalists has now met an untimely end."
 dvg_burgundy.27.f: "A prominent nobleman in Luxembourg and a vocal critic of the Burgundian Parliament he soon became the new focus of Philippe Rickwaert the owner of the paper who revealed the various affairs the duke entertained with women of little virtue throughout his various estates and properties. The duke challenged him to a duel that Rickwaert refused and then descended to Luxembourg where he shot the journalist to the death. This affair has rallied the radicals who have gathered in thousands for the burial of Rickwaert but the King can hardly let one of his supporters go in these times of need. The court packed with Parliamentarians (if one believes the Jeannist newspapers) has declared the duke guilty but the King can still pardon him."
 dvg_burgundy.27.a: "The King will pardon his friend."
 dvg_burgundy.27.b: "The judgment will stay as is."

 dvg_burgundy.28.t: "The Walloon Crisis"
 dvg_burgundy.28.d: "What was once unthinkable has happened: the Estates Generale has stood against our King demanding major concessions in the Wallonian region."
 dvg_burgundy.28.f: "In an interesting turn of events a relatively minor law in the Burgundian Estates Generale the law itself concering minor matters of Administration in Wallonian has snowballed into a major crisis point for the Political system of our nation. Allowing the Estates to get away with this could soothe tensions in the nation albeit giving administrative concessions in Wallonia to the Parlimentarists which could undermine our authority in the eyes of the people. If the King forced the Parliment to accept his demands it could anger the people but give more political power to the Monarchy"
 dvg_burgundy.28.a: "The King allows the Estates Generale to have the concessions."
 dvg_burgundy.28.b: "The King forces the Estates Gernerale to accept his will."

 dvg_burgundy.29.t: "The Arsenal of the Burgundian Navy"
 dvg_burgundy.29.d: "The development of the capital has increased the problem of silting and many fear that the works needed to maintain the military port and prevent problems in the Escaut would be too much to pay"
 dvg_burgundy.29.f: "The port of Anvers is the main port of the Kingdom and one of the biggest and more active in the world. Rotterdam on the other hand poses no such problem and is directly linked to the Rhine the main artery of commerce of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Thus the Parliament has envisioned to transfer much of the military facilities away from Anvers to Rotterdam causing uproar in the capital as the arsenal is one of the biggest employers of the city. The King profited from this to take the defence of the capital and this subject has become another divide between the Royals and the Parliamentarians."
 dvg_burgundy.29.a: "Rotterdam is best for the long term interests of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] do not listen to the rabble!"
 dvg_burgundy.29.b: "The King vetoes the law : the Navy stays in Anvers."
 
 dvg_burgundy.30.t: "De Broglie"
 dvg_burgundy.30.d: "A ranked general in the Army he also is seen as a capable administrator leading the Parti Royaliste in the Upper House. Since the times of Joseph II (1790-1817)."
 dvg_burgundy.30.f: "Lately the removed-cousin of the King Antoine de Broglie has gotten the ear of the King The Prime Minister has always come from the winner party in elections but nothing legally forces the King to do so"
 dvg_burgundy.30.a: "De Broglie will form a government"
 dvg_burgundy.30.b: "We must not upset the unwritten laws of the Kingdom"

 dvg_burgundy.31.t: "The Abdication Crisis"
 dvg_burgundy.31.d: "The conflict between Jean and the Parliament has reached its breaking point. After years of divide between the Monarchy and the deputies the Lower House has expelled the Royalists from the Chamber and declared the Crown vacant."
 dvg_burgundy.31.f: "Following this seditious act. The King mobilized the Army to disperse and arrest its leaders. Now the whole city-and the world wait for what happens next."
 dvg_burgundy.31.a: "I love democracy. I love the kingdom."
 
 dvg_burgundy.32.t: "Parliamentarian Victory"
 dvg_burgundy.32.d: "The reign of King Jean ended the day the Lower House declared against him"
 dvg_burgundy.32.f: "The troops mobilized to deal with the unrest joined the rebels. The leader of the House led the force against the Royal Palace where Jean was forced to sign his act of abdication. He was then ordered to leave his former Kingdom with his family while the Parliament assumed control of the government. The banished King could have fought but his will had been broken this day and he always refused to support the Jeannist organisations calling for his return. He would die from a heart attack 6 years later in exile his famous last words being : 'My country did not deserve my reign'. Meanwhile in Anvers Liberalism thrived as the main force of Reaction had been defeated. Now the question remains on who or what will succceed the disgraced king."
 dvg_burgundy.32.a: "Parliamentary victory should mean parliamentary rule."
 dvg_burgundy.32.b: "Burgundy has always been, and will continue to be a monarchy."


 dvg_burgundy.33.t: "The Short Estates-General"
 dvg_burgundy.33.d: "In response to the recent crisis, the authority of the Short Estates-General has been reduced."
 dvg_burgundy.33.f: "The Short Estates-General is a term describing the brief session of the Burgundian Estates-General in $YEAR$ which was abruptly ended due to attempts by the Parliamentarians to destroy the Royalist bloc. After years of animosity between monarchists and liberals the latter attempted to censure and expel all members who had advocated for the end of constitutional rule within the recent past. While technically legal this measure was instantly blocked by the Royalist majority. The royalists then called upon the King to arrest the Parliamentarians for treason alleging that they had been seeking to abolish the monarchy. Evidence of this "conspiracy" remains scarce but the Royal Army duly acted placing not just the liberal leaders but indeed all non-royalists under arrest and charging them with whatever offenses the Crown could muster. Whatever happens to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] now it seems clear that the Estates-General shall be at most an observer."
 dvg_burgundy.33.a: "I love democracy. I love the kingdom.;"


 dvg_burgundy.34.t: "The Return of the Old Monarchy"
 dvg_burgundy.34.d: "The orders of King Jean were swiftly executed as the troops circled the House and threatened to open fire if the traitors did not surrender. "
 dvg_burgundy.34.f: "While some uprisings started in the capital the police was able to take care of them and the Parliamentarians had to face the truth : no one would come to help them and their gambit had failed. Most surrendered some fled and the most radicals tried to resist only for their blood to be spilled in the Chamber. Amnisty followed for some survivors as others were thrown into jail or banished. With no resistance to oppose him the King was able to reassert his power controlling the government and repressing Liberals and Socialists that dared to criticize him. Nevertheless [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] entered a period of stability and order built on the blood of the deputies and the liberties taken away from the people."
 dvg_burgundy.34.a: "Je l'ay emprins"

 dvg_burgundy.35.t: "Crisis in Burgundy"
 dvg_burgundy.35.d: "The orders of the King were only partially executed. The Parliamentarians could count on the help of some popular rebels that diverted troops away from the Parliament and the defection of the leading general who refused to open fire on the representatives of the people. "
 dvg_burgundy.35.f: "The Parliament could not threaten the domination of the King over Anvers so they fled North. Instability followed as cities erupted in riots between Monarchists and Republicans throughout the Kingdom and especially the Netherlands. Now the spectre of war looms over the Burgundian state"
 dvg_burgundy.35.a: "A house divided cannot stand "


 dvg_burgundy.36.t: "More States Side With Utrecht"
 dvg_burgundy.36.d: "Due to the previous actions by the Jean Regime, more states have sided against it."
 dvg_burgundy.36.f: ""
 dvg_burgundy.36.a: "More traitors to purge!"

 #Civil War Happens

 dvg_burgundy.37.t: "The Utrecht Government"
 dvg_burgundy.37.d: "The Anvers Parliamentarians fled to Utrecht which opened her doors to them. From there the remaining Liberals from Monarchists to Radical Republicans gathered to declare King Jean to be an usurper because of his violation of the will of the people."
 dvg_burgundy.37.f: "They called on all the true Patriots to join them to end his tyrannous reign sponsoring revolts throughout the South. Now war is sure to come in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

 dvg_burgundy.37.a: "True Burgundy is where the blessed king is."
 dvg_burgundy.37.b: "True Burgundy is led by the elected parliament!"


 dvg_burgundy.38.t: "Victory of the Parliamentarians"
 dvg_burgundy.38.d: "The Civil War has finally ended : the Parliament of Utrecht and their supporters finally toppled King Jean and secured the southern parts of the country. King Jean has been banished from the country with many of its followers. "
 dvg_burgundy.38.f: "Many challenges await the new [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] : the Liberal coalition that held during the war could break now over the status of the state many moderates wanting to crown another King to the disgust of many Nederlander republicans. But anyway for now Jeannism as a political force has been defeated"
 dvg_burgundy.38.a: "For the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]!"

 dvg_burgundy.39.t: "Victory of the Burgundian Crown"
 dvg_burgundy.39.d: "After months of fighting the Burgundian civil war has now ended as the Parliament of Utrecht has submitted in front of the King and his armies."
 dvg_burgundy.39.f: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is now reunited under her rightful monarch that will ensure that the country will never bow down to others. Repression is harsh as most of the leading Liberal figures are banished or sent to prison for treason. The new Parliament convoked by the King is mainly filled by loyal men who will not do any thing to provoke the wrath of the King."
 dvg_burgundy.39.a: "Liberalism will not weaken [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] anymore!"

 dvg_burgundy.40.t: "The Second Rhine Revolution"
 dvg_burgundy.40.d: ";As war erupted between the Monarchists and Parliamentarians- Rhenish radicals have successfully rekindled the flame of the First Rhine Revolution and caused the region  to explode into yet another revolution."
 dvg_burgundy.40.f: "Exiles from 1848 along with countless youngmen from Germany have flooded back to the Republic to take up arms against the Burgundian Tyranny. The guns would fall silent soon after the region had been secured though as unlike the First Rhine Revolution the chaos of the Burgundian Civil War has resulted in a complete impossibility for Jean or Utrecht to take back the Rhineland. At least for now."
 dvg_burgundy.40.a: "We'll return to the Rhineland...someday!"

 dvg_burgundy.41.t: "Imminent Catastrophe"
 dvg_burgundy.41.d: "We had received word that King Jean had suffered a stroke leaving him barely conscious and throwing the Royalists into chaos. This led them to seek an armistice with us and after a series of bitter debates amongst our coalition’s leaders it was accepted."
 dvg_burgundy.41.f: "Yet this has torn [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] in two and now our coalition is collapsing as many generals accuse the civilian leadership of stabbing them in the back and permitting the indefinite division of our homeland. Several generals stationed in the Netherlands and the Rhineland are believed to be plotting against the government. We could attempt to stop them by arresting suspected traitors chiefly General Armand Petain who has always been critical of the civilian leadership. Assuming that our troops are still loyal to Parliament."
 dvg_burgundy.41.a: "The Utrecht Parliament is seized by General Petain!"
 dvg_burgundy.41.b: "Petain is to be arrested."

 dvg_burgundy.42.t: "Anarchy in Burgundy"
 dvg_burgundy.42.d: "The Civil War ended indecisively as King Jean suffered a stroke that cut the leadership of the Royalist cause forcing them to seek an armistice. In response, General Petain has staged a coup."
 dvg_burgundy.42.f: "The Parliamentarians agreed to the outrage of their generals who accused the civilian leadership of stabbing [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] in the back. General Armand Petain a fierce republican who had repeatedly criticized the Utrecht government’s political moderation led a coup d’etat in an attempt to restart the war. Instead [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] shattered into pieces with officers and Parliamentarians across the nation opting to declare their own states rather than obey the putschist general. A regency for King Jean based in Lorraine will continue but northern and western [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has seen the emergence of independent states with uncertain loyalties. It is the end of 500 years of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] existing in Europe."
 dvg_burgundy.42.a: "Everything has an end."

 dvg_burgundy.43.t: "The Nederlander Uprising"
 dvg_burgundy.43.d: "The Civil War ended indecisively as King Jean suffered a stroke that cut the leadership of the Royalist cause forcing them to seek an armistice. In response, General Petain has staged a coup."
 dvg_burgundy.43.f: "The necessity of freedom has no law. What do we care about ‘laws’ which scorn human conscience? No more shall we give any color to the tyrants who would dictate the consciences of those whom they abuse. The Nederlander people have one hope : to live in our own land. For this sacred cause we shall make our graves here. The end will show the whole truth.” - Willem IJzerdraat Nederlander nationalist\n\nMass anti-war agitation in the Netherlands in support of the Germans forced us to place much of the north under martial law. Now a revolt by the Bevrijdingsfront (Liberation Front the armed wing of the outlawed nationalist Nederlander Front Party) has been defeated only through brutal measures. Multiple rebel leaders were publicly executed but many civilians were caught in the crossfire. It is feared that any trust we once held in the eyes of the Nederlander people has been permanently lost."
 dvg_burgundy.43.a: "Death to Traitors!"
 dvg_burgundy.43.b: "Freedom for the Netherlands!"

 dvg_burgundy.44.t: "Picardy Defects"
 dvg_burgundy.44.d: "The combats between the Parliamentarians and the Royalists became too much for the local Picards whose government has decided to abandon [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] after losing faith in its government."
 dvg_burgundy.44.f: "With its strategic location between France and England, the Dual Monarchy has promised significant infrastructure development in the area, knowing well the concerns the local landowners and industrialists have regarding the turmoil from the ongoing civil war that could spill over."
 dvg_burgundy.44.a: "They will see our wrath!"
 dvg_burgundy.44.b: "We do not care about this state."

 dvg_burgundy.100.d: "The colonial government of the Cape has requested that the interim Governor, Gillebert Pierlot, be officially granted the title of Governor."
 dvg_burgundy.100.f: "Pierlot has proven himself to be a competent administrator. Instituting a 'government from afar' policy towards the Geus and native Africans; affording them a generous degree of autonomy. He believes that giving these communities nothing to resist will eventually result in them returning to work and engaging with the Burgundian economy."

 dvg_burgundy.101.f: "Commander Regnault Courvoisier is a prime military condidate to fill the Governorship. He advocates for swift and violent reprisals against the rebellious Geuzen people, and aggresive settler colonisation to secure Burgundian control. Having already drawn up plans to recapture Ylnerdam from Aloysius, he is the favoured choice among hardliners in the Burgundian court."
