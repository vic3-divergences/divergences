If we want them to truly become equal with their fellow citizens, we must prevent this segregation by forcing the sons of the Chimu and Criollo hacendados to marry among their former slaves and serfs. Soon, the Andesian people shall be one family united by marriage and blood and the colonial divisions and reactionary cultures shall disappear."

 dvg_caladero.1.t: "The Situation of Quito"
 dvg_caladero.1.d: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has always existed apart from the rest of the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire]. Conquered from the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_TWT').GetName] during the 17th Century, Spanish colonization has only truly been carried out in the urban areas around the north, such as Quito and Guayaquil."
 dvg_caladero.1.f: "After proclaiming their independence during the [concept_dvg_fifth_andine_war], revolutionaries from Quito, most notably the warlord [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_ballivian').GetFullName] (known to his adversaries as “El Podenco”), participated in a raid on the Incan capital of [concept_dvg_cuzco], pillaging and sacking the city.\n\nIn retaliation, prince [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_washkar').GetFullName] led an army northwards, rampaging all the way to Chan Chan before Dom [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], duke of Túpac-Cuzi de Ingapirca, rallied a multi-ethnic army of [concept_dvg_chimu] warriors and Spanish-descended settlers to repel the Inca. The duke was made Viceroy of New Toledo for his efforts, but the years since then have seen [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] politics snarl in unfamiliar directions. Rumors of secret societies run rife around the colony, and most players haven't yet shown their hands."
 dvg_caladero.1.a: "Dreaming of riches, not in a position to make a difference..."
 dvg_caladero.2.t: "The House of Túpac"
 dvg_caladero.2.d: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_TWT').GetName], the Incan Empire, fell into civil war during the 17h Century. The Inca claimant with ties to [concept_dvg_chimu] nobility, [concept_dvg_paullu_tupac_cuzi] had control of [concept_dvg_chinchaysuyu], but sought an edge over his rival, [concept_dvg_poma_waman_amaru]. He thus made the dangerous gamble of approaching [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SPA').GetName] for aid."
 dvg_caladero.2.f: "Sensing an opportunity, the Spanish agreed. Some say Paullu simply stalemated Amaru, others that he was sabotaged, but eventually the Spanish took over his domain, transforming it into the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\nThe first Duke of Túpac-Cuzi (often referred to simply as Túpac) was the grandson to Paullu Tupac, awarded the title in 1701 by King João III of Spain. The dukes then took up residence in Lisbon and married into European nobility. In 1810, the current duke's father was made Director of the Golden Board of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ATL').GetName], holding the role until 1820, and leading the family to return to the continent. Now, Duke [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s tenure as Viceroy has led to most of his relatives joining him in their old Chimu estates."
 dvg_caladero.2.a: "Back to the West Coast!"
 dvg_caladero.3.t: "La Sociedad de Carmelistas"
 dvg_caladero.3.d: "In 1815, when the absolutist King Pedro III ousted the reformist José II with [concept_dod_anglois] assistance, the liberal revolutionaries of the Sociedad de Carmelistas fled abroad. They arrived in Quito one year later, but failed to gain traction and eventually dissolved."
 dvg_caladero.3.f: "Now [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_sandino').GetFullName], a political exile from Western Spain, has founded a new Sociedad de Carmelistas. The so-called New Carmelistas are a group of utopian liberals who are committed to many radical causes: they demand the subordination of the military to civilian leadership, as well as the establishment of a protectionist and secular government which devolves power onto local community councils.\n\nStrangest of all is their “[ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] Dream”, which holds that Quito represents the synthesis of Andean and European civilization, the only foundation upon which true democracy can be built. While current laws force them to organize in secret, they may pose a problem in the future."
 dvg_caladero.3.a: "How bizarre."
 dvg_caladero.4.t: "El Amigo del Pueblo"
 dvg_caladero.4.d: "El Amigo del Pueblo is one of the most prominent newspapers in Quito, published by radical author [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_muyuroney').GetFullName]."
 dvg_caladero.4.f: "Unlike most other papers, which cater to the conservative aristocracy, El Amigo del Pueblo is a liberal-leaning newspaper with growing popularity among the small but notable [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] middle class. While our administration can certainly appreciate a diversity of viewpoints, the newspaper's recent editorials have brought sharp criticism against the regime.\n\nThey have criticized the Viceroy as being a “subservient appendage of Lisbon,” accusing him of courting public support while remaining loyal to the upper classes and the aristocracy. Many of the articles skirt [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] laws on supporting seditious groups, and several of the Duke of Túpac's aristocratic peers have urged him to shut the paper down, but he demurred, remaining aloof as to how he intended to respond."
 dvg_caladero.4.a: "Will those liars see the penitentiary, or will they stay free?"
 dvg_caladero.5.t: "Rumors About Muyuroney"
 dvg_caladero.5.d: "News of the Carmelista secret society is hard to come by, but we believe they have undergone a change in leadership. The rising fame of El Amigo del Pueblo has brought equal fame to its proprietor, [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_muyuroney').GetLastName]. It seems that the Carmelistas see him as more ambitious, confident, and passionate than [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_sandino').GetFullName]."
 dvg_caladero.5.f: "Though the latter man remains a force within the movement, especially among its more moderate elements, Muyuroney's star appears ascendant. If rumors are to be believed, the author may have assumed leadership of the society itself, or at least eclipsed Sandino as its figurehead.\n\nWhile nothing is certain and both men still cannot be legally proven to be Carmelistas, what Sociedad communications we've identified speak of Muyuroney with newfound importance and mention Sandino far less often. This is rather concerning, as whereas Sandino was a more typical liberal ideologue, Muyuroney is a radical firebrand who has been fined for libel multiple times and just barely avoids imprisonment for seditious language."
 dvg_caladero.5.a: "Just more gossip"
 dvg_caladero.6.t: "An Open Letter to the Carmelist Gentlemen"
 dvg_caladero.6.d: "In response to recent articles in El Amigo del Pueblo criticizing the viceroy, the Duke of Túpac has published a pamphlet countering the charges made against him by the liberals."
 dvg_caladero.6.f: "Defending his record of “acting with fidelity as the obedient servant of all [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective]s,” the Duke has denigrated the Carmelitas as being “overcome by delusions of grandeur,” “ensconced within ivory towers or candlelit basements,” and “utterly out of touch with the actual condition of the people and their needs…in short, mere romantics.” In contrast, the Duke writes, he and his loyalists represent “the only realistic course of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] government, one which responds to the condition of the nation and its people as they are, rather than as one may imagine them to be.”\n\nWhile the pamphlet has bolstered his support among the less radical elements of the population, it also seems to have backfired. Muyuroney has recently published an article in which the society he allegedly leads was for the first time referred to as the “Romanticos”."
 dvg_caladero.6.a: "Well, then, let the Duke's loyalists be true realists - Los Realistas!"
 dvg_caladero.7.t: "The Duke visits Chan Chan"
 dvg_caladero.7.d: "The Viceroy Dom [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has visited Chan Chan, capital of the Cajamarca province and home of the Chimu people. The city saw heavy fighting during the Battle of Chan Chan, also known as the Battle of the Army of the Volunteers, owing to the multi-ethnic nature of the ad hoc army which the Duke rallied against Washkar Inca. The Chimu have a bitter history with Tawantinsuyu : they were rivals before being conquered by the legendary Inca emperor Pachacuti."
 dvg_caladero.7.f: "When Spain undertook the Third Andine War in 1662, the Chimu defected in exchange for political privileges which they still enjoy because of the continuing warfare in the Andes. Most of the Chimu nobility, having married Criollo heiresses and converted to Christianity have been loyal to Spanish rule but they still cultivate a distinct identity as the 'noblest hidalgos of the continent'. The visit was seen as an effort to court the support of local lords against the Romanticos, with many veterans saluting the viceroy in memory of the victory he secured."
 dvg_caladero.7.a: "The Duke needs all of the friends that he can find, these days."
 dvg_caladero.8.t: "The Plan of [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.GetString]"
 dvg_caladero.8.d: "The threat of the Spanish and the Inca has caused the unthinkable : The Duke of Túpac, Sandino, and Muyuroney have formed an alliance! All three have gathered in Quito, in conditions of great secrecy but which was rumored to be anything from a plan to kill the duke to a ploy to arrest the entire Romantico leadership. Instead, a stunning proclamation was issued in which the three political titans explained their intentions to join forces to protect Quito. Already, the Duke has confirmed the “total extinction” of any remaining ties to the Spanish crown."
 dvg_caladero.8.f: "Several Romantico militias have already emerged from hiding to bolster the ranks of the existing military. While many doubt that this partnership can last any longer than is absolutely necessary, so long as they collaborate it seems like they might be able to unite the nation behind them."
 dvg_caladero.8.a: "¡Por Unidad!"
 dvg_caladero.9.t: "Choosing a Generalissimo"
 dvg_caladero.9.d: "If we are to effectively lead an armed revolution then we must decide who shall command our forces. While all three members of the ruling triumvirate are in theory equal, Sandino was only included to keep the Romanticos united and has little military experience. Thus we must choose between the Duke of Túpac and Muyuroney."
 dvg_caladero.9.f: "The duke's charisma and excellent strategic and tactical mind is unquestioned, but he is still an aristocrat and vesting such power in him could be dangerous for our democracy. Muyuroney is less skilled, though still somewhat adept at offensive operations, and is a committed foe of monarchism, but is also conceited and vain. It is questionable if he could inspire the same confidence and loyalty as a general that he did as an author."
 dvg_caladero.9.a: "All eyes on Túpac!"
 dvg_caladero.9.b: "Muyuroney augurs better for our democratic future."
 dvg_caladero.10.t: "The Manner of Promotion"
 dvg_caladero.10.d: "Our revolutionary army is taking shape but we need to establish how its men should be able to rise through the ranks. The Duke of Túpac, yielding to the vast liberal pressure amongst the coalition, has proposed that lower-rank officers be elected by their own soldiers, while higher-rank officers be promoted based upon their performance in the field. Though the Duke sees this as a compromise, it has unnerved the Romanticists, who are cognizant of the many incidents in history when revolutionary generals leveraged their reputations into seizing power."
 dvg_caladero.10.f: "Thus they have proposed that revolutionary committees and their delegates be the ones to monitor officers’ performance and recommend promotions, for the military high command to be democratically elected, and for civilians to be able to withdraw said commissions by recall vote. This system would be more resistant to tyranny and corruption but it would make Romantico values the army’s standard of conduct."
 dvg_caladero.10.a: "Fortune favors the bold and so shall we"
 dvg_caladero.10.b: "We cannot risk any Caesars."
 dvg_caladero.11.t: "The Question of the Curacas"
 dvg_caladero.11.d: "The curacas of Chimu and other coastal areas in Quito were formerly Inca magistrates who ruled ayllus, imperial family units, serving various roles such as tax collectors and priests. When Spain conquered the northern section of the Inca Empire, the curacas were allowed to keep significant privileges in exchange for assisting the administration. Now some have suggested folding the curacas into its command structure, since curacas, like all Inca nobles, were expected to be military leaders and many have served in our army in the past. "
 dvg_caladero.11.f: "This would strengthen our influence among native groups and increase our manpower, but to win their loyalty we would likely have to confirm their old privileges. The Romanticos may value Andean culture as part of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] identity, but they see the curacas as remnants of the old regimes which must be swept away. Therefore they have urged that we instead work to bring the curacas’ subjects into the army without their old lords, cultivating democracy and republicanism amongst the native peoples."
 dvg_caladero.11.a: "Welcome these honorable men into our ranks!"
 dvg_caladero.11.b: "Liberty, not aristocracy, must animate the army."
 dvg_caladero.12.t: "The Coalition Dissolves"
 dvg_caladero.12.d: "The triumvirate of Túpac, Sandino, and Muyuroney has finally fallen apart. Fissions are wracking the military and the civilian administration, and people throughout the nation are now taking sides."
 dvg_caladero.12.f: "While outsiders might see these political issues as merely a binary divide between Realistas and Romanticos, in truth the Romanticos are also divided between Muyuroney's loyalists and the liberal remnants of Sandino's supporters. It would be far easier for Muyuroney to take power by making concessions to the less radical Romanticos rather than attempt to rule unopposed. Meanwhile, the Duke of Túpac seeks to put an end to the Romantico threat for good and consolidate power as an unrestricted leader of Quito. It soon becomes clear that the winner of the struggle is none other than…"
 dvg_caladero.12.a: "To the victor the spoils!"
 dvg_caladero.13.t: "The End of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] Assembly"
 dvg_caladero.13.d: "The Duke wasted no time smashing the Romanticos once he had enough military and civilian personnel loyal to him. Sandino and Muyuroney were both executed for treason, and many of their compatriots are heading into prisons and graves across the nation. Some of these men resisted. Some of these men will never resist again. While the surviving Romanticos have gone back underground, the organization has been dealt a severe blow. Not satisfied with the crushing of his main rivals, the duke decided to put an end to representative democracy entirely."
 dvg_caladero.13.f: "In an announcement before the Cortes Nacionale in Quito, he dissolved the assembly, and postponed elections to compose the new assembly “indefinitely.” Rumor has it that there will not, in fact, be any new elections at all, but that the duke shall select the new legislature personally. For he, with the military and the civil service behind him, is no longer a mere duke, or even a viceroy. He is a president – the undisputed President of Quito."
 dvg_caladero.13.a: "¡Viva el Presidente!"
 dvg_caladero.14.t: "A Truly Romantic Republic"
 dvg_caladero.14.d: "Muyuroney allied with the other Romantico factions wasted no time in smashing the Realistas once they had enough military and civilian personnel in his confidence. The Duke of Túpac was ousted by a contingent of soldiers, and met his end in the Quito barracks. To replace Túpac, the Assembly has voted for the old Sandino to become the head of the state as the first president of the revolutionary [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] Assembly, hoping he can act as a moderating force between Don Willka moderates and Muyuroney and the radicals."
 dvg_caladero.14.f: "With the Romanticos in charge, pamphlets and broadsheets are being printed and distributed across Quito to bring the news of the revolution to the people. Across Quito, true local democracy is being established, all according to enlightened Romantico guidelines. And now that the revolution has been secured in Quito…"
 dvg_caladero.14.a: "It soon will enlighten the world!"
 dvg_caladero.15.t: "The Power Struggle"
 dvg_caladero.15.d: "It took less than two months for the Coalition members to accuse each other of betraying the Revolution and sabotaging the Constitutional process. To aggravate the matters, President Sandino was shot by a former retainer of Túpac in broad daylight as he went to the Assembly to present a new plan of action for the Revolution."
 dvg_caladero.15.f: "As the Constitution is not yet written, the radicals in the Assembly have demanded the establishment of a collective Autonomist Revolutionary Committee which should handle affairs of state with members elected by the Assembly every two months, while Don Willka has demanded that he should succeed Sandino as President of the Assembly and prevent the rise of anarchy with a shared executive. It now falls to the indecisive and nonpartisan deputies of the Assembly to decide."
 dvg_caladero.15.a: "Willka should become President"
 dvg_caladero.15.b: "The Comité carries the day"
 dvg_caladero.16.t: "A Meeting with the Romanticos"
 dvg_caladero.16.d: "The Duke of Túpac is no friend to the Romanticos, but the continued burden of Spanish rule has caused him to agree with them on one point: Quito cannot remain a mere colony of a faraway European power. Thus, he has reached out to the Romanticos through his own intermediaries to arrange a meeting with them. It took several weeks of touch-and-go exchanges, but Túpac was finally able to secure the audience of some of the highest-ranking Romanticos under conditions of strict secrecy."
 dvg_caladero.16.f: "From the start, the meeting was tense, and it only got worse when the Romanticos laid out a series of demands upon which their assistance would be contingent. Enfranchisement of the natives, nationalization of the largest church estates, and a democratically elected military high command were some of their most notable points. The meeting concluded with…"
 dvg_caladero.16.a: "The Duke of Túpac swallowing his pride and negotiating with them."
 dvg_caladero.16.b: "The Duke storming out of the room!"
 dvg_caladero.17.t: "The Return of Ballivián"
 dvg_caladero.17.d: "When revolutionaries [concept_dvg_de_herrera], Martin Ballivián, and Guillermo de Blanco looted Quito and raided the Incan capital of Cusco, they incurred the wrath of Washkar Inca, who organized an Aimara army and caught them by surprise during their escape. Herrera perished, Ballivián was disgraced, and de Blanco fled into the wilderness."
 dvg_caladero.17.f: "Washkar led a retaliatory rampage all the way to Chan Chan, defeated only by the timely arrival of the Duke of Túpac and his ad hoc army of Quitan, Chimu, Quechua, and Spanish forces. However, with de Blanco once again waging war against Spain, another one of de Herrera’s old compatriots has returned from hiding. An army of Balliviánists, supplied by de Blanco, has stormed into Quito, with Ballivián himself arriving in Quito on a whaling ship. Ballivián’s rapid advance caught nearly all [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective]s off guard, and he has been proclaimed President of Quito as both the Realists and the Romanticists head back into the political underground."
 dvg_caladero.17.a: "Viva el Presidente!"
 dvg_caladero.18.t: "Ballivián's Insurrection!"
 dvg_caladero.18.d: "When revolutionaries [concept_dvg_de_herrera], Martin Ballivián, and Guillermo de Blanco looted Quito and raided the Incan capital of Cusco, they incurred the wrath of Washkar Inca, who organized an Aimara army and caught them by surprise during their escape. Herrera perished, Ballivián was disgraced, and de Blanco fled into the wilderness."
 dvg_caladero.18.f: "Washkar led a retaliatory rampage all the way to Chan Chan, defeated only by the timely arrival of the Duke of Túpac and his ad hoc army of Quitan, Chimu, Quechua, and Spanish forces. Now, however, de Blanco has launched a new revolution against Spain, and has aided his old compatriot Ballivián in making a bid for Quito! Traitorous army units are already mutinying in favor of the guerilla leader, but there still remain enough loyal forces that Ballivián might be able to be thwarted with a swift enough response, unless the revolt gains too much momentum…"
 dvg_caladero.18.a: "The mutiny spreads and sweeps Ballivián into the presidency!"
 dvg_caladero.18.b: "The mutiny is crushed, and Ballivián flees into exile once more!"
 dvg_caladero.19.t: "The Second Army of the Volunteers"
 dvg_caladero.19.d: "While Ballivián was able to secure generals’ loyalty with vast concessions, the common people had not forgotten his role in the ransacking of Quito."
 dvg_caladero.19.f: "Native, mestizo, and Spanish communities all burned with rage at the thought of the man who laid waste to their homes now ruling them. In the face of Ballivián’s dictatorship, the Romanticists used their secret societies to rally anti-Ballivián sentiment across Quito, and the Realists agreed to an emergency alliance to save the nation. This led to the formation of a multi-ethnic Second Army of the Volunteers, inspired by the ad hoc force which defeated Washkar Inca. Yesterday, they launched revolts throughout the Quito countryside before converging upon the city. Ballivián sallied forth with his loyalists, but the Volunteers shattered the dictator’s army and seized Ballivián, trying, convicting, and executing him for treason. A new government has been formed, and with the Realists sidelined, the Romanticists have taken the lead in bringing revolutionary democracy to Quito."
 dvg_caladero.19.a: "May the Revolution burn eternal!"
 dvg_caladero.20.t: "Collapse of the Colombian and Herrerian Revolutions"
 dvg_caladero.20.d: "The flame of independence in the Spanish New World has been extinguished, stamped out by the boots of the Spanish Land Army. As the rebellious lands are reorganized back into viceroyalties and the old colonial hierarchy reasserts itself, we find our position precarious indeed."
 dvg_caladero.20.f: "Quito has become a byword for treachery among the Spanish royal court, and we must decide as to how we shall approach the Spanish Empire now that it has won its blood-soaked triumph. Shall we submit to the inevitable and render up ourselves to the Crown, confirming our vassalage? Or shall we make a final stand for freedom and liberty?"
 dvg_caladero.20.a: "All we can do is tend our gardens beneath the Spanish flag."
 dvg_caladero.20.b: "We must dare to dream the impossible dream!"
 dvg_caladero.21.t: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] War of Independence"
 dvg_caladero.21.d: "After New Granada was restabilized, an envoy was dispatched to New Toledo to formally confirm their place within the Spanish Empire and make a general assessment of the local conditions. Unexpectedly, the envoy was violently ejected from Quito, which has declared itself an independent republic!"
 dvg_caladero.21.f: "It seems that de Herrera’s spirit of liberty has returned to haunt the Spanish New World for one final time. The last battle for the Spanish Empire begins now."
 dvg_caladero.21.a: "Deus vult!"
 dvg_caladero.22.t: "The 5th of March Demonstrations"
 dvg_caladero.22.d: "Spain’s position in the New World continues to be thrown into doubt. After the Crown announced its recognition of the independence of the Colombian Confederation, and the dissolution of the Golden Board of Atlantia, the Romanticists escalated their liberal rhetoric. This has culminated in a series of protests in Quito to object to Spain’s onerous rule. They focused on three points: first, that it was [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective]s, not Spaniards, who won the day against Washkar Inca, second, that Spain had never acknowledged or healed New Toledo damage during the War of 1826, and third, that a Crown-appointed caudillo and emphasis on Lisbon’s role in administration is an obsolete system in need of reform."
 dvg_caladero.22.f: "The decision to hold the protests on the 5th of March was especially provocative: the First Mexican Republic was proclaimed on that day in Mexico City in 1817. The Duke of Túpac has made vague assurances of reforms but the event has further inflamed political tensions in Quito and may have caught Spanish attention as well."
 dvg_caladero.22.a: "As if we needed more trouble…"
 dvg_caladero.23.t: "Responding to the 5th of March Demonstrations"
 dvg_caladero.23.d: "Political turmoil has wracked New Toledo, our errant viceroyalty in western Ameriga. Its current Viceroy, the Duke of Túpac, was given the job in recognition of his role in assembling the Army of the Volunteers, a ragtag force of Chimu, Quechua, mestizo, and Spanish forces, to oppose Washkar Inca, who rampaged through Quito all the way to Chan Chan in retaliation for revolutionaries [concept_dvg_de_herrera], Martin Ballivián, and Guillermo de Blanco raiding the Incan capital of Cusco. Túpac has proven a mercurial caudillo, one with dubious political ideas who continues to push the limits of acceptable conduct for a viceroy."
 dvg_caladero.23.f: "Recently, protests have erupted against our rule in Quito, and Viceroy Túpac has been alarmingly slow to retaliate against them. Furthermore, Spanish officers in Quito have reported suspicious activity between known [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] radicals and individuals believed to be affiliated with de Blanco. This clearly requires action, but what sort?"
 dvg_caladero.23.a: "Reprimand Túpac, he must remember his place and his oath."
 dvg_caladero.23.b: "Demand that Túpac arrest all radicals within the colony!"
 dvg_caladero.24.t: "They Refuse!"
 dvg_caladero.24.d: "The Duke of Túpac has defied us! The viceroy has refused to support a crackdown within New Toledo, claiming that such a move would endanger the colony's stability. This unprecedented defiance from a viceroy has shocked the royal court, and our ministers are now urging the King to remove Túpac and his administration from office – by force if necessary."
 dvg_caladero.24.f: "The major risk in doing so is twofold: first, it would require redirecting resources which are currently being used to surveil and suppress radical agents in New Granada, and second, it might provoke the Duke to take extreme measures to defend himself. Yet if we do nothing, these problems shall continue to worsen and the clandestine flow of aid to New Granadan radicals may grow, not to mention the international loss of face. How shall we address the situation?"
 dvg_caladero.24.a: "Send a sharper reprimand to the Duke."
 dvg_caladero.24.b: "Order the Land Army to remove the Viceroy by force!"
 dvg_caladero.25.t: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] Revolution"
 dvg_caladero.25.d: "When news reached [SCOPE.sCountry('quito_scope').GetRuler.GetFullName] that the Spanish Land Army was mustering to oust him by order of the Crown, he decided that desperate times called for desperate measures. At a hastily convened meeting of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] political leaders, including Chimu and Quechuan lords, [SCOPE.sCountry('quito_scope').GetRuler.GetFullName] declared the independence of the Republic of Quito! "
 dvg_caladero.25.f: "[SCOPE.sCountry('quito_scope').GetRuler.GetLastName] cited the continued tyranny of the Spanish government, specifically the reviled Petrine Reforms, as his motivation, and promised to form a wide coalition to defend against Spain. With both Spain and Quito gearing up for the struggle to come, certain things have fallen by the wayside – such as the targeting of de Blanco’s supply lines, which have quietly resurged now that [SCOPE.sCountry('quito_scope').GetRuler.GetLastName] and the Crown have directed their attention elsewhere and the Spanish position in Quito has been abruptly terminated. As Quito prepares to fight, another revolutionary may soon take to the field in New Granada, but as far as [SCOPE.sCountry('quito_scope').GetRuler.GetLastName] is concerned…"
 dvg_caladero.25.a: "It’s just me against the world."
 dvg_caladero.26.t: "The Fate of Cusco"
 dvg_caladero.26.d: ""Kings, aristocrats, tyrants, whoever they are, are slaves in revolt against the sovereign of the earth, which is the human race, and against the legislator of the universe, which is nature." – Manuel Sandino"
 dvg_caladero.26.f: "With Cusco in our hands, Muyuroney has determined that the time has come to sever its bonds with Tawantinsuyu and cement its loyalty. For centuries, the brutal and tyrannical system of Inca rule has degraded the people and trampled upon their rights. That ends today! Our righteous citizen-soldiers are sweeping across the city, hunting down anyone who has oppressed the people. We may be the enlightened synthesis of Andean and European ways, but the cancerous and gangrenous limbs of Andean society must be pruned if we are to prosper."
 dvg_caladero.26.a: "And prune we shall."
 dvg_caladero.27.t: "The Doom that Came to Cusco"
 dvg_caladero.27.d: "'Evil is the disease and violence is the medicine. We must cut at the roots. The people must know their rights and demand them, they must be armed, they must take hold of all the little tyrants of the whole realm. They must overturn the monstrosity of their former oppressive government and erect a new and equal one in its stead. People that believe that the rest of humanity is made to serve at their pleasure will disapprove, but it is not them that we must listen to. It is about avenging the injustice inflicted upon a whole people by its oppressors.' -  Clodio ‘El Puma' Muyuroney"
 dvg_caladero.27.f: "With Cusco in our hands, the time has come to illuminate it with our revolutionary light. For centuries, the brutal and tyrannical system of the Empire has degraded the people and trampled upon their rights. That ends today! A new special military administration is ruling the former heartlands of the Empire and the Damoclinas are already a common sight on the city streets. Never again will the despotic cruelties of the Inca threaten our righteous citizens!"
 dvg_caladero.27.a: "Revolutionary justice is justice perfected."
 dvg_caladero.28.t: "La Pragmatiana"
 dvg_caladero.28.d: "The “Pragmatiana” is a term used by modern historians to describe the period of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] history in which the post-Realistas, most famously the Pragmatistas, came to power. While firmly aligned with the broad Romantic platform, the Pragmatistas emphasized a more reserved approach to government policy, as opposed to the Utopianism of early Romanticos. They are most well-known for advocating “decentralization of both state and citizen,” as described in the Pragmatista party charter of [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.GetString]. They condemned the “[ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] Dream” as “hypocritical, oppressive, and irreconcilably opposed to reality.” "
 dvg_caladero.28.f: "Instead, they advocated for a decentralized federation of "nations within a state," defining nations as corporate groups with limited self-organization. Each citizen, they argued, would naturally and willingly align with whichever group best represented them. The Pragmatistas were also pro-immigrant, yet prioritized domestic over foreign policy and have been described (not without controversy) as isolationists."
 dvg_caladero.28.a: "The flames of the Revolution are growing colder – thankfully."
 dvg_caladero.29.t: "The Land Reform Act"
 dvg_caladero.29.d: "For centuries – millenia, even! – the peoples of our land have toiled for the sake of heartless masters who put forth not an ounce of effort to reap their wealth. The infection of serfdom and feudalism ran rife through both the Spanish and the Inca Empires."
 dvg_caladero.29.f: "Generations have lived and died on land which they labored upon, but did not own, and received a pittance for their actions. No more! The new Land Reform Act has leveled the rural playing field. All tenant estates, regardless of the race of the landlord, have been broken up and handed back to their true owners, the people who farm them. As the so-called “nobles” did not deserve this land in the first place, they will not be compensated for it. Instead, we shall aid the peasants in setting up their farms and securing initial credit. The aristocracy is furious, but the people rejoice at their freedom!"
 dvg_caladero.29.a: "This land was made for you and me."
 dvg_caladero.30.t: "The Growth of Uraycusta"
 dvg_caladero.30.d: "While our nation has many important ports, none are as fast-growing as Uraycusta. The city is a world-renowned port, serving as a critical juncture for ships travelling between the Atlantic and the Pacific."
 dvg_caladero.30.f: "Wine, fruit, and copper produced across the nation often wind up being exported out of Uraycusta. The city also plays host to several foreign expatriate communities, notably Qingqiuese, Japanese, and Burgundian. Nowhere else in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can one so easily find foreign-language newspapers. While reactionaries are unnerved by the growth of the immigrant population in Uraycusta, so far, they do not seem to be moving beyond their neighborhoods within the city. For many they are simply cogs in the great economic machine of Uraycusta, and a welcome sight for the various sailors which regularly visit the port."
 dvg_caladero.30.a: "Hail the Jewel of the Pacific!"
 dvg_caladero.31.t: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] Dollar"
 dvg_caladero.31.d: "The world-renowned silver reserves of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], specifically its Potosi mine, have long furnished silversmiths with excellent materials. The Inca had experimented with different shapes and increments of metal money but has usually preferred more informal means of exchange."
 dvg_caladero.31.f: "Now, however, our joining of the Potosi mine with the global market has rapidly turned the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] silver dollar into an international standard. Renowned for the purity of its metal content and the stability of its value, many countries which do not possess a dedicated currency of their own are starting to adopt the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] dollar instead."
 dvg_caladero.31.a: "Capital!"
 dvg_caladero.32.t: "The Imperial Liwru"
 dvg_caladero.32.d: "Liwru” is an artificial word – it comes from the Burgundian “Livre” Esterlin, their national currency. It eventually became a synonym of foreign-style metal coinage because of the predominance of Burgundian trade amongst foreign merchants."
 dvg_caladero.32.f: "“The world-renowned silver reserves of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], specifically its Potosi mine, have long furnished silversmiths with excellent materials. The previous dynasty had experimented with different shapes and increments of metal money but has usually preferred more informal means of exchange. Now, however, our recent adoption of a new coinage, the imperial liwru, has led to it becoming an international standard. Renowned for the purity of its metal content and the stability of its value, many countries which do not possess a dedicated currency of their own are starting to adopt the liwru instead."
 dvg_caladero.32.a: "Capital!"
 dvg_caladero.33.t: "The National Archive Office"
 dvg_caladero.33.d: "Founded in [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.GetString], the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] National Archive Office was principally created to handle the vast among of quipus across the nation and bring them into a more readable format. These lengths of knotted cord have been used for centuries by the people of the Andes to record all sorts of information, from census and tax data to complex histories and religious narratives."
 dvg_caladero.33.f: "Expert quipu weavers could read them blindfolded. Now we have begun converting these documents – for that is what they are – into books and manuscripts, for ease of storage and reference. The work of the NAO will take years, but this undertaking will ensure that we will preserve whatever information is possible to save."
 dvg_caladero.33.a: "We’d best get to work…"
 dvg_caladero.34.t: "The Coronation of Pachacuti II"
 dvg_caladero.34.d: "The inauguration of our new Sapa Inca was attended by all the eminent nobles of the realm, as well as foreign observers. As Pachacuti II is a Catholic, certain elements of traditional Inca coronations — such as the ritual sacrifice of animals and idols — were omitted, though the ceremony was still fundamentally Incan in nature."
 dvg_caladero.34.f: "The participants gathered in the Awkaypata, the central plaza, along with golden [concept_dvg_wak'a] statues of several Catholic saints. Gifts of elegant garments and jewelry were assembled, since this ceremony was also the wedding of Pachacuti II to Anawarki, the sister of the previous Sapa Inca. The Archbishop of Quito led a prayer soliciting God and the intercession of the saints in granting the emperor health and a long life, victory in battle, many children to succeed him, and peace in his time. Once this was done, the Archbishop solemnly crowned Pachacuti II as Emperor of the Inca, to the cheering adulation of the crowd."
 dvg_caladero.34.a: "And thus dawns the Túpac Era."
 dvg_caladero.35.t: "The Birth of Maria"
 dvg_caladero.35.d: "The Emperor’s personal life has grown brighter with the birth of his newest child, a daughter named Maria. His first son was stillborn, while his second took ill and died before his first birthday."
 dvg_caladero.35.f: "He was despairing of being able to have a child, for his marriage to Anawarki was far from being happy – he married her to cement his claim to the throne, not out of any special attraction. But so far Maria seems to be a healthy and cheerful baby. The news has helped to distract from the close role which the emperor is playing in domestic politics, intervening in smaller scale matters one would normally think beneath the head of state. Though some more reactionary ministers murmur that they hope that Pachacuti II and his wife will have a son in the future, for now the realm is simply enjoying the birth of the newest member of the House of Túpac-Cuzi."
 dvg_caladero.35.a: "She has his eyes!"
 dvg_caladero.36.t: "Princess Maria Made Heiress"
 dvg_caladero.36.d: "As we have inherited a considerable amount of Spanish law, this includes the quasi-Salic provisions against female rulers. Moreover, Andean traditions abhor the notion of a female sovereign. Thus, the news that the emperor had officially designated Princess Maria as his heiress frustrated reactionaries of both backgrounds."
 dvg_caladero.36.f: "Pachacuti II’s lack of a son made it all but inevitable, but the news has been received badly by traditionalists all the same. In response to the announcement several reactionary newspapers issued editorials strongly questioning Maria’s competence or qualification to rule. The emperor responded by arresting the authors of said articles, and in one case shutting a whole paper down and confiscating its office. His restrictions on freedom of expression come as further pressure is mounting for reforms, calls which the Emperor has so far resisted."
 dvg_caladero.36.a: "Why can’t they write about something nice, like how good my daughter is?"
 dvg_caladero.37.t: "An Unexpected Retirement"
 dvg_caladero.37.d: "Emperor Pachacuti II had always intended to rule until he was incapable of governing, or until the Heavens took him, whichever came first. Some people, however, were not willing to wait that long for the expansion of democracy. A liberal conspiracy between reformist politicians and sympathetic army officers has rallied to force the emperor to abdicate – and it is led by none other than Crown Princess Maria."
 dvg_caladero.37.f: "The new Empress immediately issued a new royal charter of rights, devolving significant powers onto the national Cortes and expanding the voting franchise. Meanwhile, Pachacuti II has returned to his family’s original Chimu estate. Reactionaries are infuriated at a woman taking the throne, but most of our citizens are simply glad that the era of absolute rule is over."
 dvg_caladero.37.a: "¡Viva la Emperatriz!"
 dvg_caladero.38.t: "Maria Proclaimed Regent"
 dvg_caladero.38.d: "Last night, Emperor Pachacuti II suffered a severe stroke as he was preparing for bed. While he survived, now he is barely conscious, and not physically capable of ruling the nation. Thus, the Cortes have declared Crown Princess Maria the regent of the Inca Empire."
 dvg_caladero.38.f: "Maria has promised to rule with wisdom and fairness, and to steward and shepherd the nation. Dark rumors are swirling among reactionaries, however, that the emperor did not suffer a stroke at all but was instead poisoned or otherwise incapacitated on Maria’s orders to take power. Maria is known to be far more democratically minded than her father and it had been hoped that her succession would bring reforms. With the Regent in such a precarious position, it seems doubtful that she could afford to radically change Inca society."
 dvg_caladero.38.a: "Surely he will recover soon…"
 dvg_caladero.39.t: "Emperor Pachacuti II and his daughter Maria on Friday, [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.GetString]"
 dvg_caladero.39.d: "After almost a year of drifting in and out of consciousness, Emperor Pachacuti II finally recovered his full senses a few days ago. While his attendants had intended to break the news of the past few months to him slowly and gradually, the emperor is a cunning man even in his advanced age and ferreted out all the details."
 dvg_caladero.39.f: "He soon confronted Regent Maria, accusing her of attempting to usurp the throne, and intimating that he suspected her of poisoning him (possibly having gleaned such rumors during his investigations). Maria retorted that she was only fulfilling the role that he himself had charged her with, and that she had not done anything rash. The argument devolved into heated shouting, whereupon Pachacuti II seized the halberd-like staff which is the traditional Inca symbol of imperial office and struck Maria. To his horror, she collapsed on the floor. The stress of the situation overwhelmed Pachacuti: as the royal attendants raced into the room, they found him in the throes of a heart attack…"
 dvg_caladero.39.a: "¡Dios nos ayuda a todos!"
 dvg_caladero.40.t: "False Dawn"
 dvg_caladero.40.d: "Maria’s head wound proved fatal, and Pachacuti II died from a heart attack not long afterward. Palace officials quickly realized that allowing such news to leak out into the public could ignite chaos, inspire various Túpac-Cuzi members to feud for the throne, or even plunge the nation into another civil war like the disastrous struggle of the 17th century. Thus, the imperial clergy, recalling the ancient Inca traditions of venerating departed Sapa Incas, have declared that the emperor has “entered occlusion”."
 dvg_caladero.40.f: "All mention of Maria’s rule as regent is being erased from official records, and a [concept_dvg_wak'a] of the emperor has been placed in the throne room. The empire shall continue to be “ruled” by Pachacuti II, with the Imperial College (a council of Catholic and indigenous pagan priests) led by the [concept_dvg_willaq_umu] interpreting his will. This new regency has caused widespread agitation in the Empire as Catholics refuse this idolatry and liberals the return of Inca absolutism."
 dvg_caladero.40.a: "Long live the Emperor...?"
 dvg_caladero.41.t: "The Death of Pachacuti II"
 dvg_caladero.41.d: "The emperor survived his heart attack, but he could not bear to live with himself, knowing what he had done. He went to the palace’s kitchen and locked himself inside, and, after attendants heard a loud thumping sound and forced open the door, was found dead."
 dvg_caladero.41.f: "Perhaps inspired by his own accusations towards his daughter, he chose to poison himself using the Japanese fish which were to feature in tonight’s dinner. Tragically, Maria had not died, but was merely comatose, and awoke an hour after his death. Anguished by the revelation of her father’s suicide, she was inconsolable for days afterward. While all the empire grieves Pachacuti II, the government must continue. She has fulfilled her duty as Crown Princess and has been proclaimed Empress Maria, and her first act as sovereign has been to issue a new royal charter which empowers the Cortes Nacional and expands the voting franchise"
 dvg_caladero.41.a: "In the depths of suffering, the world has the audacity to continue."
 dvg_caladero.42.t: "The Death of Pachacuti II"
 dvg_caladero.42.d: "While Pachacuti II’s memory never failed him, by 1880 his body was rapidly declining. He lost all vision in his left eye, could not walk without a cane (and gave up trying to use stairs after 1879), and rarely ventured beyond his manor or its immediate grounds. Yet even in this state, he refused to be idle. Shortly after his retirement, he had taken up painting, importing books on the art from Burgundy, Venice, Japan, and Qingqiu."
 dvg_caladero.42.f: "The works that he produced in the final years of his life were described as “a sublime combination of European, Asian, and indigenous styles…though unrefined, possessing a sense of restrained and submerged beauty, of incipient wonder concealed in a manner which only heightens its allure.” It was at his canvas that the emperor was found dead this morning, having moved to the balcony to get a better view of the sunrise. The unfinished work, an impressionist rendering of Cusco as it was in the first Pachacuti’s time, would become a national symbol of a longing for the Inca Empire’s future."
 dvg_caladero.42.a: "From the Sun, he descended: to the Sun, he returned."
 dvg_caladero.43.t: "The Imperial Banner Raised over Tierra del Fuego"
 dvg_caladero.43.d: "The southernmost extreme of Ameriga was dubbed “Tierra del Fuego” or “Land of Fire” by Spanish explorers, who saw the bonfires lit by native tribes of the region while sailing past. Though the weather and the seas of this region are infamously dangerous, countless vessels brave it each year to round the continent."
 dvg_caladero.43.f: "Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, consolidating our administration in Tierra del Fuego. The acquisition of such a far-flung place, and the geographical security which its possession grants our empire, has increased the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people."
 dvg_caladero.43.a: "May it never be lowered!"
 dvg_caladero.44.t: "The Imperial Banner Raised over the Pampas"
 dvg_caladero.44.d: "The pampas, from the Quechua “plains,” have sustained nomadic peoples like the Het for thousands of years. Some of the best pastoral lands in the world, the pampas are also useful for farming. For many years, European colonizers have warred with the indigenous peoples, be they Beornians or other interlopers."
 dvg_caladero.44.f: "Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, cementing the consolidation of our administration of the Pampas. The acquisition of such a fertile place, and the protection from the eastern Amerigans which its possession grants our empire, has shorn up the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people."
 dvg_caladero.44.a: "May it never be lowered!"
 dvg_caladero.45.t: "The Imperial Banner Raised over Cartegena de Indias"
 dvg_caladero.45.d: "Many peoples have made their home in the Cartegena region – the Mocana of the Caribs were the most numerous when the Spanish arrived."
 dvg_caladero.45.f: "Their violent subjugation of the region led them to christen it “Cartegena de Indias” after a notable Iberian city. It soon became one of the primary colonial nerve centers, processing vast amounts of trade, and gaining an international reputation as a major Amerigan and Caribbean port. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, cementing the consolidation of our administration in Cartegena de Indias. The acquisition of such an important and famous place, and the naval power projection which its possession grants our empire, has shorn up the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people. The emperor has long styled himself the “Liberator of the Andes” and now it is a fact."
 dvg_caladero.45.a: "May it never be lowered!"
 dvg_caladero.46.t: "The Imperial Banner Raised over the Amazon"
 dvg_caladero.46.d: "The mighty Amazon River and its vast basin are home to a fantastic variety of life, plant and animal."
 dvg_caladero.46.f: "The region’s ecological beauty and diversity is overwhelming – and so is its economic potential if the tremendous obstacles of geography could be overcome. Spain made some attempts to settle the northeastern basin, but it was the Dual Monarchy which claimed its coastal edge and thus the interior, a claim inherited by Amazonie. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, cementing the consolidation of our administration in the Amazon River basin. The acquisition of such a massive and wondrous place, and the international prestige which its possession grants our empire, has shorn up the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people. The emperor has long styled himself the “Guardian of the Amazon” and now it is a fact."
 dvg_caladero.46.a: "May it never be lowered!"
 dvg_caladero.47.t: "The Imperial Banner Raised over Ava"
 dvg_caladero.47.d: "Ava, the land of the Guarani, is a bastion of indigenous culture in the heart of Ameriga."
 dvg_caladero.47.f: "Possessing considerable agricultural wealth, as well as a particularly cohesive native identity (forged in the fires of adversity from Burgundian and later Lotharian colonization), Ava’s economic possibilities have laid untapped for ages. Now, the imperial banner has for the first time been raised over the region, cementing the consolidation of our administration in Tierra del Fuego. The acquisition of such a unique place, and the strengthened defense against the eastern and southern Amerigans which its possession grants our empire, has shorn up the emperor’s popularity in the eyes of the people. The emperor has long styled himself the “Protector of the Guaranis” and now it is a fact."
 dvg_caladero.47.a: "May it never be lowered!"
 dvg_caladero.48.t: "Imperial Majesty"
 dvg_caladero.48.d: "Who can resist Pachacuti II? From the depths of strife, he has raised up the Inca Empire to heights of power and fame never seen!"
 dvg_caladero.48.f: "Even the European colonizers have been forced to admit the overwhelming strength of the Inca Empire. Across the globe, our citizens are treated with respect. The word of our merchants is implicitly trusted : the allure of our culture entrances admirers from here to Anvers : and several smaller states have looked to our military while reforming their own forces. We have brought unto Ameriga the light of order, of enlightenment, of civilization, and we have done so without shoving European colonization down the natives’ throats. All of this is thanks to Emperor Pachacuti II! It is his glorious light which the grandeur of our realm magnifies and reflects all around us. The previous dynasty made pretensions of ruling the “known world,” but only we can truly be said to have brought the glory of the Inca across the globe."
 dvg_caladero.48.a: "A radiant sovereign is he!"
 dvg_caladero.49.t: "The Pachacuti Doctrine"
 dvg_caladero.49.d: "Our influence has permeated the whole Amerigan continent. Now Emperor Pachacuti II has decided to officially announce our role as Ameriga’s shepherd."
 dvg_caladero.49.f: "In a royal proclamation, he outlined what he referred to as our “Continental Obligation as Master of Ameriga” but which foreign observers have dubbed the “Pachacuti Doctrine.” The emperor stated that any incursions by foreign powers upon the Amerigan continent would be taken as a threat to the Inca Empire. The remarks brought forth a chorus of objections from European powers, and it is questionable how many of them will take this proclamation seriously. The true value of it is its expression of our overwhelming influence upon the continent, and the unity of its peoples beneath our imperial banner, directly or otherwise."
 dvg_caladero.49.a: "We are the Protector of Ameriga!"
 dvg_caladero.50.t: "The Inca Constitution"
 dvg_caladero.50.d: "Pachacuti was no stranger to European Liberal thought, and one of the changes he made to the Empire was the election of local officials by the population."
 dvg_caladero.50.f: "He has now decided to grant a constitution to the Inca Empire which has resulted in several traditional elements of our political system shifting to accommodate new ideas. The Cortes Imperiales has been formed to legislate policy – though with plenty of input from the emperor, of course. A separate judiciary has also been established, though again the imperial court holds significant influence within it. While democracy is slowly being embraced by the people, many aspects of our society remain apart from foreign liberal ideals. Still, the inevitable weakening of royal authority inherent in the expansion of democracy has necessarily reduced the hold the emperor over his country."
 dvg_caladero.50.a: "He is still great regardless!"
 dvg_caladero.51.t: "The Inca Constitution"
 dvg_caladero.51.d: "Pachacuti was no stranger to European Liberal thought, and one of the changes he made to the Empire was the election of local officials by the population."
 dvg_caladero.51.f: "He had decided to grant a royal charter to the Inca Empire but his proposed document was heavily modified at the insistence of many notable politicians. The resulting constitution  of the Inca Empire has created a great transformation of our political system. The Cortes Imperiales acts almost wholly separate from the emperor’s will, while the judiciary stands upon its own footing as well. Democracy and related ideas of popular power have swept across the nation, and much of our society is realigning towards it. This has substantially reduced royal authority and grandeur in a culture where the sovereign has for ages reigned in an absolute manner."
 dvg_caladero.51.a: "Yet his brilliance still cannot be denied."
 dvg_caladero.52.t: "The End of the Inca Empire"
 dvg_caladero.52.d: "For roughly four hundred years, the Andes were dominated by the Inca Empire. The region and the polity had for so long cohabited the same space that, in the minds of their subjects, they had become almost synonymous."
 dvg_caladero.52.f: "But, as despot after despot came and went, the free spirit of the people persevered, never losing hope that one day they would be delivered from their servitude. That day has now come! Túpac's dream of claiming the Inca throne and becoming another link in the chain of tyranny binding the people has been shattered. Rather than his absurd and hypocritical cherry-picking of Hispanic and Andean culture, both wholly self-serving of his imperialist aims, the national culture of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is now being realigned. The Romanticos are now hailed as our political ancestors, and their ideas used as the foundation for new political groups and aspirations."
 dvg_caladero.52.a: "Freedom delayed and denied no longer!"
 dvg_caladero.53.t: "The Beornian War"
 dvg_caladero.53.d: "For too long, we have suffered the abuses of the insolent Beornians. Their raids have terrorized our southern frontier, and they have long sought to conquer vast swaths of said lands."
 dvg_caladero.53.f: "If we are to ever be fully secure as a nation, then we must take severe measures to prevent the Beornians from ever threatening us again. The time has come to extend the hand of our protection over the indigenous peoples of southern Ameriga and drive the Beornians back eastwards. They will be allowed to possess the land necessary to survive, but never again will they raise their hands against our subjects."
 dvg_caladero.53.a: "Camelot shall fall!"
 dvg_caladero.54.t: "The Inkans Attack!"
 dvg_caladero.54.d: "When we heard that the Inkan Empire had been conquered by the heretical Catholic [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective]s, we were all astonished, though it made some amount of sense given the modicum of superiority the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective]s held over the Inkan savages. What was truly shocking was when the mad ruler of Quito claimed the Inkan throne for himself and founded a new imperial dynasty!"
 dvg_caladero.54.f: "We always knew that Catholics were foul crypto-pagan heretics but few of us ever dreamed that fellow Christians would be capable of such insanity. Now, the northern abomination that is the new Inkan Empire has launched a war of aggression against us! Their treacherous diplomats babble all sorts of justifications for this, but we know that they are simply violent brutes. As our priests marshal the faithful for holy war, the sons of England prepare to crush these monstrous heathens."
 dvg_caladero.54.a: "For king and country!"
 dvg_caladero.55.t: "The Treaty of Camelot"
 dvg_caladero.55.d: "To the astonishment and horror of all our subjects, the Beornians have bested the imperial armies. A series of losses along the frontier allowed the Beornians to invade the interior to the point where the emperor was forced to sue for peace rather than allow further devastation of the countryside."
 dvg_caladero.55.f: "The Beornians demanded that he travel in person to their capital city of Camelot. There, in a shameful ceremony, he was forced to publicly acknowledge their monarch as the rightful king of Beornia, England, and “New Mercia,” their appellation for the frontier regions which they have now annexed. Even worse, it seems that the unruly Mapuche have taken the opportunity to launch yet another revolt and given the state of the imperial armies it seems that they will succeed for the time being. Pachacuti II and the whole Inca Empire have been humiliated."
 dvg_caladero.55.a: "The Sapa Inca turns to the sky for answers but receives only rain."
 dvg_caladero.56.t: "Colonization of the Andes"
 dvg_caladero.56.d: "The conquest of New Mercia was followed by an intense propaganda by the Beornian state to show the rest of the civilized world that their conquest was just because of the Inca aggression. New Mercia proper and especially the port of Edward's Landing were targeted for propaganda actions which showed the progress of civilization thanks to Beornian settlers."
 dvg_caladero.56.f: "However, the seizure of local lands by the settlers and the Beornian administration were of course never mentioned. In the mountains, far from international observations, the Beornian army was free to destroy villages and accorporate land for future colonization with countless villages burnt. When the Beornians did not act directly, entire villages were left to starve, resulting in one of the most brutal massacres of the XIXth century."
 dvg_caladero.56.a: "Beornia acted in self-defense!"
 dvg_caladero.57.t: "White Peace in the Andes"
 dvg_caladero.57.d: "Despite the best efforts of the Inka hordes, our mighty armies cloaked in the grace of God have fended off their assault upon our innocent kingdom."
 dvg_caladero.57.f: "In the resulting peace treaty, the Inkans have been suitably humiliated. They have been forced to recognize our righteous sovereign as the rightful King of Beornia, forsaking their claims to any lands which we currently control. While some had hoped for a more decisive victory, many simply rejoice in the defeat of the heathen foe."
 dvg_caladero.57.a: "God be praised!"
 dvg_caladero.58.t: "The Year of Shame"
 dvg_caladero.58.d: "Not since 1066, on that evil day when the Norman usurpers forced the yoke of slavery upon the Anglo-Saxon neck, have the faithful sons of England known such dark times as this. The savage Inkan despot has driven the whole Beornian Army from the field and arrived under arms at the gates of Camelot. He then demanded that King Edward surrender all lands beyond Avalon, or he would destroy Camelot. Facing annihilation, Edward had no choice but to accept."
 dvg_caladero.58.f: "The Bible tells us that the rainbow was a promise from God – a sign of His covenant with humanity that He would never send a deluge to destroy the world again. That symbol, which has given hope and joy to Christians of all ages for centuries, is no longer beloved. As the rainbow standard rises across the former lands of Beornia, it has become a blasphemous reminder of their victory over us. [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.GetString] will always be remembered as the epoch of our greatest failure, the Year of Shame."
 dvg_caladero.58.a: "My God, my God, why has Thou forsaken me?"
 dvg_caladero.59.t: "Beornia Neutered"
 dvg_caladero.59.d: "As we had expected, the Beornians proved little challenge for the imperial armies. A series of victories across the southern mountains and plains allowed the soldiers of the Inca Empire to surround the capital of Camelot."
 dvg_caladero.59.f: "Threatening to destroy the city, our Sapa Inca forced their pitiful “king” to surrender all desired lands to our enlightened rule. Even now, the imperial bureaucracy is dividing the new lands for mitma resettlement. The current occupiers will likely pose a problem, inclined as they are to cling to their backwards nation and their bizarre Protestant Christian sect, but as time goes on they will learn their place within the empire."
 dvg_caladero.59.a: "And if they don’t, we have ways of disciplining them."
 dvg_caladero.60.t: "Religion in the Inca Empire"
 dvg_caladero.60.d: "When Emperor Pachacuti II established our new imperial dynasty, many of both Catholic and traditional indigenous faiths were concerned about the religious future of our realm. Pachacuti II, however, knew that attempting to either stamp out the existing worship of gods like Inti, or discard the Catholic faith in favor of said gods, would be equally ruinous paths. Yet at the same time the emperor himself is still a Catholic and he does not pretend otherwise."
 dvg_caladero.60.f: "Therefore, he has instituted liberty of personal conscience for religion, but allocating support towards the Catholic Church and depicting Catholic saints in the manner of certain local gods to encourage conversion. While Catholicism is not being imposed there is a general sense amongst our citizens that being a Catholic (or at least acting like one) is the best way to socially advance. Native believers are of course embittered by this but most are focused on preserving traditional ways rather than attempting to destroy the state’s aid of Catholicism."
 dvg_caladero.60.a: "In the beginning was the Word…"
 dvg_caladero.61.t: "The Civil Constitution"
 dvg_caladero.61.d: "For ages, the fetters of organized religion have kept our citizens in chains. Both the Catholic Church and the state-managed faith of the natives were used by the elite to bind the people and subordinate their interests. This is no longer the case."
 dvg_caladero.61.f: "We have taken great pains to exclude any mention of any religion from our constitution, and instituted strict, absolute, inviolable separation of church and state. No religious organization will receive so much as a penny of government funds from here on, and all churches must pay taxes. Ceremonies such as marriages, which used to require a priest, can now be accomplished through a simple civil procedure. While traditionalists of all religions are severely displeased by our actions, we are hopeful that future generations shall inherit a nation free of sectarianism or the sinister manipulations of the clergy."
 dvg_caladero.61.a: "Emancipation of the mind at last!"
 dvg_caladero.62.t: "A More Stable Republic"
 dvg_caladero.62.d: "The Revolution is over! You yourselves have destroyed it by violating all your principles. It no longer has the respect of anyone - Don Willka’s answer to a Radical Romantico deputy"
 dvg_caladero.62.f: "The vote was short but nonetheless a victory for Willka. Denouncing the corruption of the Assembly, the Radicals tried to get the army and the people to rise but they were soon crushed by Willka forces, likely paid with his own money or funds given by the Chimu families he is close to.. The coup attempt allowed Willka to purge his opponents while posting his own men at key posts in the Republic. Popular suffrage even for local elections has been suspended, with a new Assembly elected by the wealthy."
 dvg_caladero.62.a: "Willka new Republic - oligarchy"
 dvg_caladero.63.t: "The Abolishment of Serfdom"
 dvg_caladero.63.d: "One of Dom Willka’s main campaign promises was the immediate abolition of serfdom, a corrupting practice which had taken hold of the Andes in the last decades and one that every powerholder in the area partook in, exploiting the peoples of the Andes for a quick profit. Dom Willka isn’t one to go against profit and prosperity, such an institution must not be allowed to exist in a modern republic prepared for the times ahead. "
 dvg_caladero.63.f: "While the nobles and aristocrats behind serfdom rallied behind Willka during the tumultuous times before his ascension as president of our nation aren’t taking to this lightly, Willka assures them that while their power and wealth isn’t up for negotiation, so isn’t the freedom and liberty of the people."
 dvg_caladero.63.a: "Dom Willka, el Liberador!"
 dvg_caladero.64.t: "The [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.GetString] Act against treason"
 dvg_caladero.64.d: "In order to satiate the nobility of Chimu and the myriad caciques in the Andes, Dom Willka and his assembly have made their goals clear at attaining stability in the Andes."
 dvg_caladero.64.f: "The former Inca alongside their associated royals will be put to trial and their wealth confiscate and the former Spanish hacendados plaguing Quito and Guayaquil summarily executed do treason against the Andes and its people"
 dvg_caladero.64.a: "Justice for the people!"
 dvg_caladero.65.t: "Empresas Mixtas de Cajamarca"
 dvg_caladero.65.d: "When Dom Willka abolished serfdom and proceeded to free those under its yoke, all of his aides and government associates knew he had a plan to satiate the former magnates of serfdom and caste aristocrats who backed his movement to begin with. Thus, Willka and his allies have ideated a marvellous and boundary-pushing scheme at bringing wealth to the Andes and making sure his allies remains allies: A series of government-magnate led enterprises and companies will be created and distributed between the former nobles of the realm and Willka’s closest allies, aimed at exploiting the lands in an official manner, under the distant gaze of the state."
 dvg_caladero.65.f: "The first of these companies, inaugurated in the region most affected by the abolishment of Serfdom, Cajamarca, begins it activities today: The Empresas Mixtas de Cajamarca will be tasked with the uncovering of mineral deposits and the diversification of agricultural activities."
 dvg_caladero.65.a: "Prosperity is coming!"
 dvg_caladero.66.t: "Asociación Agro-Minera del Norte Andino"
 dvg_caladero.66.d: "The mountains and jungle valleys of the North Andean Spine have never truly been used for any economic activity other than harsh monocropping of coffee and sugar, with any other possibilities never being explored or attempted. Our experienced industrialists and oligarchs, however, after consulting with small-scale miners and adventurous farmers, have been led to the discovery of bountiful mountains of coal."
 dvg_caladero.66.f: "Along with this, the southern half of Herreria was also found to be suitable for diversification in cultivation, with spices such as pepper taking hold and rapidly expanding through the smaller sharecroppers of the Cauca Valley. Thus, the newly-born Asociación Agro-Minera del Norte Andino has been granted paramount rights to any coal deposits and has also been granted large tracts of lands in the southern valleys, with the paramount objective of bringing wealth and prosperity to the Northern Andes, as well as moving its economy away from the terrible colonial structure imposed unto us by our former masters."
 dvg_caladero.66.a: "Mountains of coal and mountains of cloves!"
 dvg_caladero.67.t: "Consejo Económico del Sur Andino"
 dvg_caladero.67.d: "The valleys, forests and mountains of Chili were long known to the Incans and Aimara before them as bountiful lands, with traditional economies using the vast valleys for cattling, seasonal farming as well as the mining of both silver and copper since time immemorial. While the Incan Empire never truly made Chili a cornerstone of their economy, instead being relegated as a frontier, our wise industrialists see the potential in this land from every single angle."
 dvg_caladero.67.f: "Thus, we shall appoint a body concerning the economic development and exploitation of Chili’s resources, hoping to truly transform the valleys from a backwater to a true economic powerhouse within Andesia - From mining, to fishing, to agriculture, the Consejo Económico del Sur Andino will make sure to oversee the economic ascension of Chiri within Andesia, spurring colonial efforts and sponsoring the foundation of a number of cities, which they assure will bring our state profits unending."
 dvg_caladero.67.a: "A new industrial heartland?"
 dvg_caladero.68.t: "Unión Agrícola de los Llanos"
 dvg_caladero.68.d: "The vast plains of the West-Aurelianan llanos, owing to their far-flungness and lawlessness, have never been truly settled or exploited economically, being misused for small-scale cattling and fishing along the banks of its rivers. However, our great industrialists see great potential in this land as a possible breadbasket, which has led to the formation of a plan to turn the llanos into the agricultural heartland of Andesia, providing grain and jobs to the peoples while turning this backwater into a truly important part of our state."
 dvg_caladero.68.f: "The formation of the new Unión Agroindustrial de los Llanos will oversee development in the area, starting with the foundation of a string of new settlements with the goal of funnelling migrants to the vast llanos and bring prosperity to them, of course, and a good margin of profits!"
 dvg_caladero.68.a: "A new breadbasket?"
 dvg_caladero.69.t: "A truly revolutionary Republic"
 dvg_caladero.69.d: "The Comité sidelined Willka’s bid for power only for him to try to take power by force. His mercenaries were however no match against the power of the people who rallied to defend their deputies."
 dvg_caladero.69.f: "In cities and towns across Quito, orders have gone out to destroy the enemies of liberty : the Damoclinas are being raised up throughout the nation, where anyone known to have worked for the Duke, the Spanish or the ‘aristocratic’ faction of Willka. shall meet their fitting end - Willka  was their first victim. Meanwhile in the capital, a frightened Assembly has confirmed the powers of the Comité and their spokesperson, Muyuroney. While a Constitution is being drafted, the country shall be ruled by the elected members of the Comité who already have published decrees for the coming war with the barbarous Empire of the Inca, notably that all adult males shall be enrolled into the military, as must any man who wishes to obtain [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] citizenship from now on."
 dvg_caladero.69.a: "No mercy for the enemies of liberty! ¡Viva la revolucion!"
 dvg_caladero.70.t: "The Rule of Terror"
 dvg_caladero.70.d: "As promised by the Comité, Andesian society is being reorganised in accordance with true Romantic principles, the enlightened synthesis of Andean and European culture. Many thought that the Rule of Terror launched by the Comité after Willka’s coup would end with the execution of the last Inca emperor and the new peace, but the Comité has now turned his attention towards the enemies of the interior."
 dvg_caladero.70.f: "Popular committees, so far restricted to urban centres and a few outposts in the countryside, target the priests, aristocrats be they newly conquered caciques or [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] citizens. While weariness is a common feeling for many of the Andesian people, especially in the new ‘Republican territories’ of the dead Empire, few can express it and Revolutionaries just seem bound to radicalize more and more … but up to what point?"
 dvg_caladero.70.a: "It is satisfying to be able to announce to a free people that the fatherland is going be saved."
 dvg_caladero.71.t: "The Revolutionary tide"
 dvg_caladero.71.d: "As the ‘Mallku’ of the Qullaw is under the protection of the Burgundians who approached him to secure their sulphur and silver trade in Baie d’Argent, we can hardly provoke the Burgundians into a full fledged war. Thankfully for us, the Lupaca leader Tupac Katari has approached us with a plan : a large shipment of weapons from Burgundy is planned to arrive in Arica by next month."
 dvg_caladero.71.f: "His followers will take control of the port and use the weapons to take power on the Altiplano. While this will allow us to prevent a direct war with Anvers, there might be consequences still, especially as a few Burgundian traders live in the port. We have urged Katari to pay attention and prevent any harm to the Europeans but his newly Republican zeal matches the zeal of Clodio Muyuroney."
 dvg_caladero.71.a: "As long as the King is removed!"
 dvg_caladero.72.t: "Blood on the Qullaw"
 dvg_caladero.72.d: "Armed and smuggled by Andesian agents, Tupac Katari leader of the Lupaca has seized Baie d’Argent and then used the Burgundian weapons he seized to march on Shinkillaqta to seize power. The monarchy has been abolished and Tupac Katari proclaimed himself Protector of the new Qullaw Republic."
 dvg_caladero.72.f: "Life for the average Qullaw citizen does not change much: Katari has put his own kin at the highest positions in his new ‘Republic’ and all the important offices of state are in the hands of his clan or allied clans."
 dvg_caladero.72.a: "A good development for the Qullaw"
 dvg_caladero.73.t: "The Baie d’Argent incident"
 dvg_caladero.73.d: "More news from the Andes as Burgundian merchants have been attacked in our former port of Baie d’Argent by Qullaw rebels funded by the Republic of Andesia. Tupac Katari, a marginalized tribal leader of the Altiplano took Baie d’Argent by surprise and the weapons we had sold to the King of the Qullaw by the same occasion."
 dvg_caladero.73.f: "Burgundian stores and warehouses have been looted and a few merchants have died in the troubles. Then Katiri and his followers surged to the capital and took power while establishing a Republic recognized by Andesia the following day. Again we are forced to deal with the fall of the Inca Empire and many in our government are asking that we simply let go of the region while demanding a compensation from the real people behind this outrageous attack : Andesia. But for the others, an attack on Burgundian subjects demand a strong response against the godless Republicans."
 dvg_caladero.73.a: "Ask only for compensation"
 dvg_caladero.73.b: "Civis Burgundio sum"
 dvg_caladero.74.t: "Burgundian threats"
 dvg_caladero.74.d: "Katiri may have gone too far in his actions. After he left Arica, we stumbled on Burgundian traders who had died in the troubles and it is no surprise the Burgundian government is demanding compensation for the loss of property and lives experienced in Arica."
 dvg_caladero.74.f: "While we generally understand that Burgundy does not seek war but merely a diplomatic solution, their terms would be harsh for our Republic and also be seen as submission to imperialism by Radicals but refusing this deal could mean an embargo that would also be detrimental to our economy or #red worse a direct military intervention!#!"
 dvg_caladero.74.a: "We will compensate the Burgundians"
 dvg_caladero.74.b: "We do not bow to foreigners!"
 dvg_caladero.75.t: "Andesian compensation"
 dvg_caladero.75.d: "The Andesian agrees to compensate for the damages they have caused"
 dvg_caladero.75.f: "Our threats have worked : the Andesian government has agreed to our demands, giving financial compensation to the victims of Baie Salée while also giving privileged status to our merchants. Many in our government feel that we have gained a better deal since we keep our influence and even extend it."
 dvg_caladero.75.a: "Burgundian might solves all problems"
 dvg_caladero.76.t: "Andesia refuses"
 dvg_caladero.76.d: "We were shocked to learn that the Andesians refused our offer. Newspapers in Anvers are demanding that we take action and the political opposition rejoices to see our plans fail so utterly."
 dvg_caladero.76.f: "We are left with two options now : organize an embargo on Andesia, forbidding them to take loans from our banks, and destroying the trust others could have with them or we take military action as the jingoist members of the cabinet have demanded."
 dvg_caladero.76.a: "An embargo will destroy them more effectively than military intervention."
 dvg_caladero.76.b: "”Civis Burgundio sum”, we should have listened to that the first time…"
 dvg_caladero.77.t: "The Burgundian embargo"
 dvg_caladero.77.d: "The Burgundian government has severed diplomatic ties with our Republic and enacted an embargo on our country."
 dvg_caladero.77.f: "Our financial capacities were already quite limited because of the distrust our Revolution has engendered amongst the bankers of Europe, but having the Burgundian government embargo us has made the matters worse. We might have stood up to an imperialist power but we are likely to pay the price in the coming years."
 dvg_caladero.77.a: "There is no price for freedom!"
 dvg_caladero.78.t: "The Collao Sister Republic"
 dvg_caladero.78.d: "With the matter of Burgundian demands solved, Katiri has accepted our treaty of friendship and allowed our agents and soldiers into the South Andine Republic."
 dvg_caladero.78.f: "The rule of Katiri is tenuous, as the followers of the Mallku agitate against the new clans in power and the tight network of relationships that built the Qullaw state in the first place, lies broken. With our administrators helping solidify the Republic and our soldiers experienced in dealing with insurgents, our sister Republic shall soon be a haven of democracy and republicanism!"
 dvg_caladero.78.a: "Peace and Freedom in the Andes!"
 dvg_caladero.79.t: "The Conquest of the Collao"
 dvg_caladero.79.d: "The Qullaw, a natural extension of any country claiming sovereignty over the Andes, finds itself under foreign occupation."
 dvg_caladero.79.f: "With the power vacuum left by the fall of the Incan Empire, Burgundian merchants were quick to move into Shinkillaqta and install themselves as the region’s pre-eminent powerholders. This situation must end, no oligarch shall decide the future of the children of the Andes!"
 dvg_caladero.79.a: "Shinkillaqta will be under our wing soon!"
 dvg_caladero.80.t: "The Speech on the Enemies of the Interior"
 dvg_caladero.80.d: "’How could liberty ever have established itself amongst us? Apart from several tragic scenes, the revolution has been nothing but a web of farcical scenes… But it is in the nation’s senate that the most grotesque parades have taken place. Fifty years of anarchy await you unless a true statesman and patriot arise with powers akin to the dictators of Ancient Rome. O prating people, if you did but know how to act!’ - Clodio Muyuroney"
 dvg_caladero.80.f: "In the last few weeks, Muyuroney fell sick, forcing him to reduce his political presence to a minimum. It thus surprised the whole Assembly when he came unannounced and likely still suffering from a fever, and made a two-hour long speech in which he denounced both the moderates of the Assembly and his allies in the Comité. After being removed from the Tribune by force for his call to insurrection, uneasiness pervaded the Assembly : for many moderates, it was their time to act."
 dvg_caladero.80.a: "Muyuroney is arrested at the behest of the Assembly!"

 dvg_caladero.81.d: "”Five or six hundred heads lopped off would have assured you repose and happiness; a false humanity has restrained your arm and suspended your blows; it will cost the lives of millions of your brothers.” - Clodio Muyuroney"
 dvg_caladero.81.f: "The trial was short and brief. Clodio Muyuroney, the architect of ‘El Terrór’, along with his collaborators in the Comité have been subjected to a quick trial without jury, with a simple verdict being ruled out: Treason. Upon hearing this verdict, the last words uttered by Clodio rang through the building like a maddened scream: “If I am guilty of something, let it be of Romance, because I adored my motherland so.”"
 dvg_caladero.81.a: "Sic semper tyrannis"
 dvg_caladero.82.t: "The Constitutional Convention of [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.GetString]"
 dvg_caladero.82.d: "With the death of Muyuroney and the dissolution of the Comité, a new morning dawns upon the citizens of Andesia. Tthe remaining moderates and liberal-minded individuals in the National Assemlby must now decide the immediate political future and structure of Andesia."
 dvg_caladero.82.f: "The first speeches have unanimously denounced Muyuroney and his minions in the Comité as the sole responsibles of the ‘Terror’ that plagued the nation, despite most deputies approving the decisions of the said comité not a month ago. In an ironic twist of fate, Gabriel Marquez de Susa, ‘the Executioner of Cuzco’, famous for his use of cannons during the mass execution of the Inca nobility, and friend of Muyuroney until recently, presides the Assembly and the debates. While the remaining liberal firebrands who distanced themselves from Muyuroney’s actions demand for the revolution to continue, albeit moderately, the more conservative-minded actors suggest reorganizing the country akin to Dom Willka’s old ideals to finally restore order and bring prosperity to the Andes."

 dvg_caladero.83.d: "”To our friends, the world. To our enemies, not even justice” - Enrique de Anchorena, close aide to Muyuroney."
 dvg_caladero.83.f: "Against all odds, Clodio Muyuroney and his Comité have succeeded in destroying the remaining opposition. Ravingly popular, the regime enjoys rapturous support in the lower rungs of society, while oligarchs and the nobility can only watch from the sidelines and shudder. With this, Muyuroney has dissolved the Assembly and assumed total powers from the Palacio de Gobierno, with the ‘Terrór’ coming to an end and a sense of relative normalcy permeating the streets of Andesia, El Jefe shall exercise the will of the people with extreme prejudice against those threatening it, be it from within or without."

 dvg_caladero.84.d: "Clodio Muyuroney, the lunatic self-declared ‘Jefe Supremo de Andesia’ has assumed power of Andesia’s government apparatus and concentrated all of its power around himself, citing security concerns and the need of direct and rapid action against the enemies of the Romantic Revolution."
 dvg_caladero.84.f: "Muyuroney’s act is an existential threat to our continued independence, as the flame of his revolution threatens to consume the entirety of the Andes."
 dvg_caladero.84.a: "To Arms!"
 dvg_caladero.85.t: "The Federalist Revolt"
 dvg_caladero.85.d: "Cajamarca, and more specifically the Republic of Chimor have always been a hotbed for federalist, oligarch-infested politics - Enemies of the revolution through and through, Dom Willka’s party has left a long-lasting legacy in the Chimu Coast, with various remnant political movements adhering to his thought and seeing this moment of weakness as the perfect opportunity to revindicate them."
 dvg_caladero.85.f: "Already reports from the Centroandean district and the Qullaw tell of Federalist sympathies and failing in putting down this act of subversion and treason against our Fatherland would surely spell the end of our regime, as the importance of the Chimu coast, from symbolically to economically, is of gargantuan size."
 dvg_caladero.85.a: "We march to Chan Chan!"

 dvg_caladero.86.d: "With the victory of the Federalist revolts against Muyuroney’s draconian centralism and oppression, the Andesian dream lies dead in the water."
 dvg_caladero.86.f: "True democracy now ushers in a new age for the independent states of the Andes, and the former Republic of Andesia is dissolved, although the imprint left by Muyuroney and the Románticos’ reign of terror won’t be gone with the sweep of a pen, as were their dreams and aspirations."
 dvg_caladero.86.a: "Goodbye, Muyuroney!"
 dvg_caladero.87.t: "Victory of ‘El Jefe Supremo’"
 dvg_caladero.87.d: "The enemies of the Revolution have been stamped one after the other. Chan Chan, the festering birthplace of Willka’s ‘Federalist’ movement, has been scoured and its rag-tag revolt stamped down with prejudice."
 dvg_caladero.87.f: "The stragglers in the self-declared ‘Andes Republic’ suffered the exact same fate, with the leaders of the massively unpopular revolt being quickly put to the sword without any trial. With this, Muyuroney has fully solidified his position as ‘El Jefe Supremo del los Andes’, the Supreme Leader of the Andes. None shall stand between the will of the people and Muyuroney!"
 dvg_caladero.87.a: "Praise our Jefe!"
 dvg_caladero.88.t: "El Infante"
 dvg_caladero.88.d: "Muyuroney’s ailing health was an open secret, one that his confidants were terrified of discussing with the Puma. On this day, the former Supreme Leader retired to his personal estate in the outskirts of Guayaquil, renouncing his post and letting his son, Francisco Atanasio Muyuroney, who the people know as ‘El Infante’ - a gesture referring to his father’s king-like state, steer the ship of state in his stead."
 dvg_caladero.88.f: "Unlike his character, Muyuroney’s absconding wasn’t preceded by any speech, instead being a relatively quiet affair, with the former Jefe Supremo donating the last two years worth of his salary alongside returning the spoils of war of the Federalist Revolt back to their owners, a surprising act, even if ‘El Puma’ was never known to be a particularly money-inclined individual."
 dvg_caladero.88.a: "Good luck, Francisco Atanasio!"
 dvg_caladero.89.t: "Unravelling Chiri’s Subjugation"
 dvg_caladero.89.d: "Before renouncing to his post, El Puma made sure to let his son know that until its former oppressors are gone from the continent, the peoples of the Andes will never truly be free, a fact that ‘El Infante’ took to heart."
 dvg_caladero.89.f: "Thus, the first act of his play will be to retake the lands of Chiri, rightful territories of any aspiring contender to the Andes and a reduct of European oppression and perversion."

Few could imagine that their intervention would be defeated by the Republican armies with Burgundy forced to accept their loss of influence in the former Inca Empire."

 dvg_caladero.102.d: "When Burgundy intervened following the Arica massacre and the coup in Qullaw against the Andesian Republic, the Anvers government had little plan besides showing reprisal for the killing of their merchants."
 dvg_caladero.102.f: "The Republicans refused peace following the bombardment of their ports and the Burgundian army had to march on the capital and occupy the countryside. The Republican leaders have not deposed arms and chose to flee to the countryside. Some Moderates were assembled and proposed the inauguration of an European monarch to restore order to the country. Burgundy then searched for a ‘neutral candidate’ which would increase the legitimacy of the new Empire and approached the Aragonese Prince Francis-Ferdinand. The third legitimate bastard of King Joan IV, the Prince has bought off the claims of the Túpac-Cuzi family, adopted a converted son of Khispallu Inka, and has arrived in [SCOPE.sState('capital_state').GetName] where he has been crowned Emperor of the Andes. The Republican guerilla has seemingly increased since his arrival, and without Burgundian troops to maintain order, few observers think that this new Empire will survive."

 dvg_caladero.103.d: "Andesia accepted peace after our invasion but it has not been easy to form an amicable government. Convinced that the Republican government has proved disastrous to the region, our government searched for potential emperors in Europe after assembling conservatives and moderates to form a Regency while our forces occupied the capital."
 dvg_caladero.103.f: "A Burgundian prince was out of the question and so were Protestant Germans. In the end the Andesian delegation, which we had assembled, met with Francis-Ferdinand de Salina, an Aragonese prince, whose Catholic faith would be more amenable to the mestizo elites of the region. Now, he sits on the throne of a precarious country : guerrillas are still active and without Burgundian forces, it is doubtful he will be able to rule for long. However we now hold two protectorates in the Andes, which should supply our industry and finances with plenty of silver and minerals."
 dvg_caladero.103.a: "A Burgundian shall feel confident that Burgundy will protect him against injustice and wrong, in whatever land he may be."
 dvg_caladero.104.t: "An Aragonese Inca"
 dvg_caladero.104.d: "Out of the three legitimized sons of Joan IV, Frances-Ferran de Salina-Lampedusa stood out as the least interested in politics and generally content with his life on his demesne. That is, until a delegation from the Andes flanked by Burgundian officials approached him to become the new leader of the Empire of the Inca."
 dvg_caladero.104.f: "After consulting his wife and daughter, he then decided to accept the offer and sail to Ameriga. Some Aragonese hoped that this would offer new trading opportunities for our merchants, but this new Empire appears to be mostly a Burgundian puppet. Rumors of guerillas and general instability abound, and many wonder how much time Frances-Ferran will be able to rule."

The consequences of our pre-emptive invasion of Andesia are our demise. The Neogranadine dream dies, and our great country is shattered into its constituents, with the lands of Herreria falling under direct jurisdiction of Andesia, as the northernmost province to be incorporated unto it, the final piece of the Andesian puzzle. While a united New-Granada may be dead for the time being, the Granadine peoples will never forgive nor forget."

What they didn't expect to find, however, was an army committed towards the ideals of freedom and love- Soon, through hardship and with many lives lost, the rag-tag band of Neogranadine of soldiers of fortune was pushed to the negotiating table, leading to the demise of New Granada and the trial of its corrupt, warmongering leaders. On this day, the denizens of Herreria are freed, and José De Herrera's legacy lies redeemed, with his people finally freed from the grasp of tyrants."

 dvg_caladero.112.d: "Both the Viceroyalty of New Toledo and the Empire of the Four Corners are no more. While Túpac has succeeded in his tasks of setting both of his peoples free, there is much work to be done. The southern half of the Empire lays under the influence of Burgundian merchants, and Túpac remains nothing more than an unrecognized caudillo in the eyes of the world, an emperor without a crown. In Quito and Chancay, intellectuals mock what they call "La Mestizocracia", criticizing how the nation is now run by naturalized nobles."
 dvg_caladero.112.f: "While Túpac's own heritage isn't a secret, it is clear that if the Empire of the Inca is in dire need of guidance. Hinged between Romanticists heeding Spain's call and dozens of groups dreaming of representation and liberation, the future of the Andes will be decided by the choices taken by Túpac and his Imperial Assembly."

 dvg_caladero.113.d: "Lording over the vast mountains, jungles and deserts of Andes is no easy feat. While the Incans in the Tawantinsuyu did so with a famously great efficiency thanks to their extensive bureaucratic apparatus, our new state finds itself at a standstill."
 dvg_caladero.113.f: "With the conquest of the former realm we inherited a large bureaucratic body, which is seen as both a blessing or a curse, depending on the faction concerned. While these bureaucrats could be hammered into collaborators, convinced of our Empire's role as a steward of the Andes, there are others who see them as nothing more than possible traitors waiting for an opportunity to strike. However, along with the haughty hereditary bureaucrats in the Empire's administrative centers, various petty lineages of lowly aristocrats exist strewn around the empire, and they'd surely be thankful to our Emperor-to-be if they were granted a better position. A decision has to be made regarding the status of these bureaucrats."

 dvg_caladero.113.b: "Promote lesser nobles to act as a counterbalance!"
 dvg_caladero.114.t: "The Organization of our Empire-to-be"
 dvg_caladero.114.d: "With the question of the old nobility answered, there's another matter that needs to be tended to before we can set our sights on the south. With the annexation of what remained of Tawantinsuyu, we've inherited an administrative system that extremely differs from ours. While the former colonies of the Viceroyalty of New Toledo were under a decentralized system of federal courts representing each of the constituencies, Incan lands were divided into four corners, which in turn were subdivided based on population at a given point in time, prone to fluctuation."
 dvg_caladero.114.f: "These two systems clash greatly, and a definition has to be reached regarding how Túpac's empire will organize. While extending the cortes to the south would please would put us on a path towards modernization, in the eyes of the west, many argue whether completely replacing a 400-year old system would be ideal"

 dvg_caladero.116.t: "Qullaw on the Horizon"
 dvg_caladero.116.d: "The Qullaw, our rebellious, albeit rightful province, finds itself sponsored by the Burgundian magnates of Anvers, operating out of the old treaty port of Baie d'Argent."
 dvg_caladero.116.f: "Our claim to these lands is non-negotiable, and thus we will seek a peaceful resolution with the merchants lording over the rebellious governor of Shinkillaqta, so that no blood may be spilled over something which would be resolved by the stroke of a pen."

 dvg_caladero.117.f: "They assure us that they don't want any bloodshed to occur, as any blood spilled would sully their image - They are adamant to claim that they've got nothing to do with the previous warmongers of the Tawantinsuyu. How do we respond to their demands?"
 dvg_caladero.117.a: "We are interested in selling Baie d'Argent and retiring from the Qullaw."

 dvg_caladero.118.a: "Their prepotence will be their undoing"
 dvg_caladero.119.t: "The Burgundians Agree"
 dvg_caladero.119.d: "Having seen our honesty and desire for peace, the Burgundians have agreed to pull away from Baie d'Argent and leave this corner of the world alone."
 dvg_caladero.119.f: "However, this won't come for free, and they demand an economic compensation for doing so, which although unfair, is to be expected from the wealthy merchants dominating Anvers."
 dvg_caladero.119.a: "At least no blood was spilled."

 dvg_caladero.120.d: "With the influence of the perfidious Burgundians cleared from the Qullaw, we are now free to descend upon the rebellious governor of Shinkillaqta, restoring what is rightfully ours."
 dvg_caladero.120.f: "While we shall inherit a broken and war-torn land, our Empire is a new one and we will not repeat the mistakes of the Tawantinsuyu, a new Collao will be reborn under Túpac!"

Great strides will be taken in achieving this, a great new city will be erected upon the Collao's former capital, and the reins of state will be temporarily handed to now-Viceroy [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_juan_pablo').GetFullName], a capable administrator and distant member of the house of Túpac-Cuzi's Spanish line."
 dvg_caladero.121.f: "As the ninth intendant of Jauja, during his tenure he took great strides in bringing the intendancy up to speed with the rest of New Toledo, setting up schools in the furthest reaches of Jauja and modernizing its formerly ossified civil service. With a short ceremony held in the former Shinkillaqta, Juan Pablo is crowned, titles are distributed and preparations begin for the welcoming of new settlers."

 dvg_caladero.122.d: "Such as the Collao before it, the valleys of Chiri are a rightful part of the Empire of the Inca."
 dvg_caladero.122.f: "With the fallout of the Great Amerigan War this vast tract of land finds itself under Spanish influence after a puzzling turn of the events. By sending a delegation to the governor in Nueva Murcia, we hope to establish a healthy relationship that'll hopefully end with the transition of Chiri from one Spanish and Catholic power to another."

 dvg_caladero.123.d: "A Hispano-Andean delegation has reached the humble abode of Chiri's governor in Nueva Murcia de Indias."
 dvg_caladero.123.f: "They intend to seek a peaceful and fruitful relationship with us, which'll hopefully lead to the cession of Chiri towards them. Our tenure in Chiri has been nothing easy to maintain, and that much is known by the overburdened staff fighting constant guerrilla, and the small stream of settlers facing every hardship imaginable. To this end, our chancellors are suggesting the proposal of a condominium over Chiri, so that we may not lose our economic interests and also avoid war while making a premium - This, of course, would lead to the eventual cession of Chiri, but massive profits in the short-term!"
 dvg_caladero.123.a: "We will send forth a proposal for a condominium."
 dvg_caladero.123.b: "No, this land is worth too much."
 dvg_caladero.124.t: "A Condominium over Chiri?"
 dvg_caladero.124.d: "The Spanish have proposed a condominium over Chiri - They intend for us to pay them a large sum of money, along with several years worth of salary to the overburdened colonial staff, in exchange for handing the reins of the Crown Colony of Chiri until the end of the governor's tenure or until we are able to pay them off."
 dvg_caladero.124.f: "This is an interesting proposal, as it allows for both the pacification of these rowdy lands as well as the normalization of relationship with Spain."

 dvg_caladero.126.t: "The Condominium of Chiri"
 dvg_caladero.126.d: "The Condominium of Chiri is now a reality - While under our nominal influence in every single way, the governor in Nueva Murcia de Indias responds and is paid for by the upstarts in Cusco."
 dvg_caladero.126.f: "While this arrangement may only last for several years, it is succesfuly making a sizable amount of money and ridding us from that ungovernable tract of land."

 dvg_caladero.127.t: "Scandinavia in Chiri" 
 dvg_caladero.127.d: "Such as the Collao before it, the valleys of Chiri are a rightful part of the Empire of the Inca."
 dvg_caladero.127.f: "With the fallout of the Great Amerigan War this vast tract of land finds itself under Scandinavian rule - Chiri's inhabitants, having been influenced by Scandinavian missionares for the last few decades, have more or less welcomed the Scandinavian's rule over the valleys with contempt, some of them still yearning for the Tawantinsuyu's return, mainly the skilled Picunche bureaucrats inhabiting the central Araucania. Thus, we shall send forth a delegation tasked with negotiating Chiri's return to us!"

 dvg_caladero.128.d: "A Scandinavian-Andean delegation has reached the Governor of our newly-established colony of Arakanie in Ragga, seeking what they call a "peaceful transition" of what they believe is their rightful land back to them."
 dvg_caladero.128.f: "While our situation in Chiri is relatively stabled, owing mostly to our continued missionary activity, several native groups within Chiri still yearn for the return of Tawantinsuyu. If we were to discuss terms of annexation with the new Empire of the Inca, we could so in the basis of them protecting the large numbers of Protestant Mapuche and the new Scandinavian settlers in the land, safeguarding our influence there for the future."
 dvg_caladero.128.a: "A reasonable request for them."
 dvg_caladero.128.b: "We're not going to sell such a valuable colony to an upstart Empire."
 dvg_caladero.129.t: "The Scandinavian Refusal"
 dvg_caladero.129.d: "The Scandinavians have refused to hand over our rightful subjects and our rightful land back to us, citing fears of oppression of their new citizens and the peoples they've proselitized over the last decades."

 dvg_caladero.132.f: "We intend to honor Scandinavia's requests, and thus we shall extend rights to the peoples in Chiri - Some parties may not be particularly enthusiastic about this idea, citing the warlike nature of the Mapuche and the harm they've brought to Chiri and the Andes, but what's done is done."
 dvg_caladero.132.a: "The Collao is whole once more!"
 dvg_caladero.133.t: "Chiri under the New-Mercians"
 dvg_caladero.133.d: "Chiri, due to a chain of events leading to the destruction of pre-established entities and the settling of vast numbers of liberal, nationalistic Beornians in its vast valleys, finds itself under the thumb of both Scandinavia and Beornians."
 dvg_caladero.133.f: "However, these Beornians have the intent of returning back to their homeland, which is currently under occupation by a feudal, isolationist theocratic regime led by a maddened friar. If, via less savory means of communication we were to promise these Beornians assistance in reclaiming their homeland in exchange for them claiming allegiance to us, we would be able to take down Scandinavia and guarantee us an ally in the future."

 dvg_caladero.134.t: "New-Mercian Stragglers"
 dvg_caladero.134.d: "Ever since the rise of the new Empire of the Inca, our New-Mercian subjects in Arakanie have been more rebellious than usual."
 dvg_caladero.134.f: "They are furiously demanding home-rule, with some going as far as to openly kick out our crown-appointed governors and set up self-governing bodies in the farthest path of Arakanie. This is a worrying trend, one that must be quickly stamped out before it fully consumes our governing body in Chiri!"
 dvg_caladero.134.a: "We will prepare for the worse, onwards!"

 dvg_caladero.135.f: "With their uprising against Scandinavia successful, we will keep our end of the bargain and fulfill our promise of restoring a rightful, true Beornian protectorate by banishing the insane despotic regime propped up in Camelot by the most backwards of priests and their allies."
 dvg_caladero.135.a: "Collaboration with Beornians? that's new."
 dvg_caladero.136.t: "The New-Mercian Uprising"
 dvg_caladero.136.d: "As many within our government suspected, being bought with false promises by the Empire of the Inca's brutish rhetoric, the New-Mercians have risen up against our colonial government, demanding our complete withdrawal from Arakanie so that they're free to exercise their destiny in overthrowing the regime in Camelot."
 dvg_caladero.136.f: "We will not let this come to pass - We'll restore our rule!"

 dvg_caladero.137.a: "Collaboration with Beornians? that's new."
 dvg_caladero.138.t: "Organization of the Beornian Republic"
 dvg_caladero.138.d: "With the end of John Faith, comes the new Beornia."
 dvg_caladero.138.f: "While the situation in the Pampas and the Cuyo foothill is pratically anarchic, Camelot is secured and under new administration - an administration purely loyal to the Empire of the Inca, to which it owes its existence. Thus, we can soon expect a mass exodus of New-Mercians towards their so-desired republic, and the dissolution of this relic of Scandinavian colonial rule."
 dvg_caladero.138.a: "A new Beornia, a new Empire?"
 dvg_caladero.139.t: "The Dissolution of New-Mercia"
 dvg_caladero.139.d: "New-Mercia has been dissolved."
 dvg_caladero.139.f: "Its settlers, keeping their end of their bargain with us, have moved in droves back across the Andes and into Beornia. While many have perished in the journey, either due to bandits in the ungovernable Cuyo foothills or during the trek crossing the Andes, their presence in Chiri is no more, and thus, it is time for us to fully incorporate our wayward province back into our administration - Along with this, we are also seizing control of the Beornian Foothills, which have fallen unto anarchy with the new Beornian Republic's failure at exerting power over itself, with a power vaccuum after John Faith's fall from power."
 dvg_caladero.139.a: "Welcome back, Chiri!"
 dvg_caladero.140.t: "Death of the Lord-Protector of Beornia"
 dvg_caladero.140.d: "The Lord-Protector of Beornia who was first appointed unto Camelot by us has passed away."
 dvg_caladero.140.f: "While during the past few years the situation in the pampas and countryside has greatly stabilized, it is obviously far from perfect in every stretch of the word - Roadside banditry is still common, and the far-flung settlements dotting Beornia remain relatively isolated from each other. Some of these settlements, particularly those near our border, have seen heavy missionary activity and have taken up Catholicism and abandoned their near-pagan ways, hoping it would bring them security in the face of continued adversity. Thus, a question arises: Do we take this opportunity to abolish Beornia, or do we emphasize this trend seen in the borders and completely destroy the Puritan religion which has led to their downfall?"
 dvg_caladero.140.a: "Beornia will see the light under Christ"
 dvg_caladero.140.b: "Beornians clearly can't govern themselves."
 dvg_caladero.141.t: "Chiri under the Mercian Theocrats"
 dvg_caladero.141.d: "Chiri, due to a chain of events leading to the destruction of pre-established entities and the settling of vast numbers of extremely religious and prejudiced Beornians in its vast valleys, finds itself under the thumb of both Scandinavia and Beornians."
 dvg_caladero.141.f: "These Beornians, however, pose an existential threat to native and traditional life in Chiri, and their sponsoring by Scandinavia truly should end at once. Such a dangerous sect shouldn't be granted free reign in corrupting lands as bountiful and rich as those in Chiri.Chiri, due to a chain of events leading to the destruction of pre-established entities and the settling of vast numbers of liberal, nationalistic Beornians in its vast valleys, finds itself under the thumb of both Scandinavia and Beornians - However, these Beornians have the intent of returning back to their homeland, which is currently under occupation by a feudal, isolationist theocratic regime led by a maddened friar. If, via less savory means of communication we were to promise these Beornians assistance in reclaiming their homeland in exchange for them claiming allegiance to us, we would be able to take down Scandinavia and guarantee us an ally in the future."

 dvg_caladero.141.b: "Any second we waste is another life lost."
 dvg_caladero.142.t: "The Hispano-Andean Petition"
 dvg_caladero.142.d: "An angry, appalled delegation from Cusco has arrived in Arakanie's colonial capital of Ragga, demanding our withdrawal of the region and the expulsion of the New-Mercians that were settled in the vast valleys and forests of Arakanie."
 dvg_caladero.142.f: "They cite a serious concern for the natives of the lands, which they consider their rightful subjects and whose livelihood they portray as existentially threatened by the mere presence of the religiously-inclined Beornians. How will we respond?"
 dvg_caladero.142.a: "We will seek to sell the colony to them."
 dvg_caladero.142.b: "So what? It is our colony."
 dvg_caladero.143.t: "The Scandinavians Refuse"
 dvg_caladero.143.d: "Not seeing the extent of the harm they're causing to Chiri and its peoples, the Scandinavians have greedily refused to negotiate over control of Chiri and the cessation of Beornian activies in the area."
 dvg_caladero.143.f: "Thus, it is up to the Empire of the Inca to take up the mantle of justice and rid Chiri of both Scandinavians and Beornians, who are predating upon Chiri's spirit in every way imaginable."
 dvg_caladero.143.a: "We will rid Ameriga of Scandinavian rule."
 dvg_caladero.144.t: "The Scandinavians Agree"
 dvg_caladero.144.d: "Having acknowledged their mistakes at harboring such a dangerous sectarian group as they did, the Scandinavians have agreed to sell us their colonial holdings in the farthest reaches of the Collao, up to the what the Tawantinsuyu called the Green River."
 dvg_caladero.144.f: "This would effectively mean that the Scandinavians would be completely out of Ameriga - However, we would be left with the task of bringing life back to this land, which finds itself plagued with foreign elements seeking to fundamentally destroy it and adapt it to their own will, completely displacing the peoples who've been autochtonous to it for centuries."
 dvg_caladero.144.a: "We will rid Chiri of savages."
 dvg_caladero.145.t: "The Arakanie Cession"
 dvg_caladero.145.d: "Our deal with the new Incans in Cusco went through, and after tense negotiations following Incan fears of harm being wrought upon those they considered "rightful children of the Andes"."
 dvg_caladero.145.f: "Chiri is handed to the upstart Empire of the Inca, without a single drop of blood being shed and with a decent premium being paid to us."
 dvg_caladero.145.a: "Goodbye, Chiri!"
 dvg_caladero.146.t: "Chiri under the Empire"
 dvg_caladero.146.d: "With our dealings with Scandinavia concluded, the lands briefly known as New-Mercia, a cursed name which will be forgotten and completely erased from the valleys of Chiri are under our firm grasp once again."
 dvg_caladero.146.f: "Bringing life back unto these lands unfairly rendered of it will be no easy task - However, no child of the Empire will be left to be predated upon and walked over by those who've been causing them harm and death for centuries."
 dvg_caladero.146.a: "The Collao is whole once more - But at what cost?"
 dvg_caladero.147.t: "The Organization of the Crown Colony of Chiri"
 dvg_caladero.147.d: "In order to bring Chiri back up to speed, the higher echelons of Túpac's Imperial Assembly have pushed a proposal regarding the temporal delegation of rule to a govening body tasked with promoting new settlements and erasing the path of destruction that both the sectarian Beornians and the opportunistic Scandinavians left behind of these lands, once brimming with activity."
 dvg_caladero.147.f: "We can, however, expect this to be no easy feat, requiring time and concentrated effort."
 dvg_caladero.147.a: "Hopefully, we'll be able to restore Chiri to its former glory."
 dvg_caladero.148.t: "The Andes, humbled for a second time"
 dvg_caladero.148.d: "Hallelujah! The Sons of Saint George have triumphed over the heathenish wave of savages washing over them from across the mountain ranges in the northernmost reaches of the lands of vast lands of Beornia."
 dvg_caladero.148.f: "The Empire of the Inca, a twisted contortion of the former Tawantinsuyu, attempted to strip the Beornians of everything they'd fought tooth and nail for, and like their predecessors, have failed yet again. With this final failure and to ensure no such indiscriminate attack against the rightful heirs of England occurs again, the Incans will be completely severed of their remaining southern possessions, with the lands formerly known as the Qullaw being restructured into a heavily monitored, and protestant state."
 dvg_caladero.148.a: "For England!"
 dvg_caladero.149.t: "The Flight of Icarus"
 dvg_caladero.149.d: "The Beornians' conquest of the Incan South wreaked havoc to its population."
 dvg_caladero.149.f: "While the Beornians may have thought that everything was under their control, they couldn't be farther from the truth, as a revitalized Empire of the Inca washed over them and avenged the mistakes of their forefathers in battle after battle. Thus, the conquests and atrocities carried forth by the Beornians are undone, and the Sons of Saint George stand broken once more."
 dvg_caladero.149.a: "Such damage can't be undone."
 dvg_caladero.150.t: "The Broken Qullaw"
 dvg_caladero.150.d: "While the true extent of the damage rendered unto the Qullasuyu by the Beornians was unknown to the Empire of the Incans, they didn't even grasp the beginning of its magnitude."
 dvg_caladero.150.f: "The lands find themselves settled by Beornians of all walks of life, to those living fleeing the squalor in Camelot or the Chaco, to those seeking further fortune - The Beornians themselves can't be blamed for the mistakes of their forefathers, and it is up to Túpac and the Assembly to decide what will befall them."
 dvg_caladero.150.a: "We will try to cooperate with them."
 dvg_caladero.150.b: "We will seek to fully integrate them, no matter the cost."
 dvg_caladero.151.t: "Our Role in the Andes"
 dvg_caladero.151.d: "Many within Túpac's assembly question the ultimate goal of both him and the Empire of the Inca going forwards into the future."
 dvg_caladero.151.f: "Thus, it is imperative to fully settle on our intentions regarding our conduct within the Andes: Said matters are divided between two camps, those adhering themselves to the ideals of Catholic Andean exceptionalism, and those seeking to shine the light of God unto those less fortunate, including the dozens of groups affected by both the previous Tawantinsuyu, as well as the myriad of Imperialist powers predating Ameriga for their own goals."
 dvg_caladero.151.a: "We will seek to settle and bring the light of both God and Europe to these lands!"
 dvg_caladero.151.b: "The light of God shines equally unto all!"
 dvg_caladero.152.t: "On Andean Warfare"
 dvg_caladero.152.d: "Warfare in the Andes has traditionally been conducted in an ad-hoc matter."
 dvg_caladero.152.f: "With our conquest and re-integration of the vast expanses of land of the Qullasuyu andi ts farthest reaches, we find ourselves governing over complicated, maze-like patchworks of militias belonging to lords and nobles from all corners of the land, trained differently, speaking different languages and possessing different outlooks on conduct during wartime. This raises a difficult question to answer, as the need for a modern army is imperative in the enlightened times we live in."
 dvg_caladero.152.a: "We will seek to standardize our Army"
 dvg_caladero.152.b: "We will maintain a semi-traditional structure"
 dvg_caladero.153.t: "An Empire for the true sons of the Andes"
 dvg_caladero.153.d: "The character of our Empire has been truly decided upon - The Empire of the Inca will not fall under the same trappings which led to the Tawantinsuyu's downfall: We will not bend to unsubordination, and we shall transpose the values of the Old World - in both material and immaterial ways, to the lands of the Andes."
 dvg_caladero.153.f: "The Empire of the Inca is first and foremost a Catholic nation, one ruled upon by the triune union of its three greatest peoples: The Quechua, the Hispano-Andean sons of Quito, and the Chimu sons of Tacaynamo."
 dvg_caladero.153.a: "Didn't Túpac promise change?"
 dvg_caladero.154.t: "A Truly Autochtonous Empire"
 dvg_caladero.154.d: "The character of our Empire has been truly decided upon - The Empire of the Inca will not fall under the same trappings which led to the Tawantinsuyu's downfall: We will not trample over our rightful subjects - what should an Emperor do if not care for them? Tawantinsuyu's downfall was brought forth by both their heathenish practices and the chaos wrought unto the former Four Corners by the overzealous and exploitative nobles appointed from Cuzco, fanatical in their nature and brutal in their approach to governance."
 dvg_caladero.154.f: "This trend, however, ends. The children of the Andes and those beyond them will see the light of Túpac and the Empire of the Inca's magnificence, as well as the light of God truly shine upon them."
 dvg_caladero.154.a: "Change at last?"

However, due to years of intermittent warfare any permanent settling of the Amazonian foothills has been nigh impossible, with settlements being abandoned and others falling to raids from the myriad Guarani and Arawak tribes, only the settlement of Umasuyu remaining intact from this incessant onslaught.
