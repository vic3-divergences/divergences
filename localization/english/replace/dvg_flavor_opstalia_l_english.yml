 je_road_to_rickusdorp: "The road to Rickusdorp"
 je_road_to_rickusdorp_reason: "Not all of the migrants came this far north during the exodus, some settled along the way and established their own homesteads in Basuto territory. Some of these settlements have become quite prosperous. Extending our control over these settlements would provide us with the resources and manpower we need to return to Niew Antwerpen... a-As well as providing them with much needed protection from native raids; of course."
 je_return_of_hendrik: "The Return of Hendrik"
 je_return_of_hendrik_reason: "While we may be the legitimate government of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_NFL').GetName], the people currently living there think otherwise. They obey the cabal of fools that forced us here, as if noble blood is worthless. No matter, our allies here will suffice in raising an army to return us to power, it is a simple matter of matching their current military capabilities."

 #Events
 #opstalia_primer.1
 dvg_opstalia.1.t: "The Geuzen Exodus"
 dvg_opstalia.1.d: "When [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BRG').GetAdjective]  colonisation of the Cape began, thousands of Dutch settlers were lured here, believing that they would find greater autonomy and economic opportunity. "
 dvg_opstalia.1.f: "They did not. Discrimination by the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BRG').GetAdjective]  administration left most settlers destitute, the viceroy of the cape labelling them 'Geus' (beggars). This led to groups of settlers, known as trekkers, migrating away from Burgundian control to found their own settlements further inland. One group, led by a peasant named Dierick, founded an incredibly prosperous settlement, now known as Dierickstadt, which has become the de facto capitol of the Geus north of the cape."
 dvg_opstalia.1.a: "Surely the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BRG').GetAdjective]  can't reach us here."

 #opstalia_primer.2
 dvg_opstalia.2.t: "The Boetzelaer Administration"
 dvg_opstalia.2.d: "When [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_NFL').GetName] declared independence from Burgundy, the leader of the trekker militias; [SCOPE.sCharacter('scope_diereckx').GetFullName], extended his support to the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('grondraad_ig').GetName] hoping to push the Burgundians further from his territory and gain an ally with access to the sea. "
 dvg_opstalia.2.f: "When the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('grondraad_ig').GetName] was overthrown in [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_NFL').GetName], a Geuzen landowner; [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] assumed control and fled to Dierickstadt. They are currently planning their return to power in Niew Antwerpen. However, should the policies of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('grondraad_ig').GetName] anger the locals, the militias may reevaluate their relationship with [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_NFL').GetName]. A relationship that favors the new government rather than [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s won't end well for the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('grondraad_ig').GetName]."
 dvg_opstalia.2.a: "We will be greeted with open arms."

 #road to rickusdorp
 dvg_opstalia.3.t: "The Road to Rickusdorp"
 dvg_opstalia.3.d: "Isolating ourselves far from [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_BRG').GetName]  control was a feasible strategy for our forefathers, but not for us. The Cape is becoming increasingly populated; bringing us greater economic development, but also drawing the attention of nearby nations and hungry colonisers."
 dvg_opstalia.3.f: "We need to build up our strength and seek new opportunities beyond our borders, lest we fall victim to a neighbour with greater ambition. The lands to the south are dotted with Geuzen settlements, holding exeptional potential for manpower and resources. They will be far better off under our rule than that of a native chief"
 dvg_opstalia.3.a: "It is quite a long way..."

 #Trans-oranje settlers
 dvg_opstalia.4.t: "The Trans-Oranje settlers"
 dvg_opstalia.4.d: "We have recieved a letter from a group of trekkers that settled north of the Oranje river"
 dvg_opstalia.4.f: "They now find themselves under the control of the mongrel '[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VRY').GetName]' government. They are requesting our protection and wish for us to take control of the area, how should we reply?"
 dvg_opstalia.4.a: "Demand that [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VRY').GetName] surrenders the territory"
 dvg_opstalia.4.b: "This is an opportunity to reclaim our property and remove a threat to our security"
 dvg_opstalia.4.c: "Ignore them"

 #vryland refuses
 dvg_opstalia.5.t: "Vryland refuses..."
 dvg_opstalia.5.d: "The leader of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VRY').GetName] has refused to recognise the wishes of the settlers"
 dvg_opstalia.5.f: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VRY').GetRuler.GetFullName] believes that they hold some kind of rightful sovereignty over the territories that they currently control"
 dvg_opstalia.5.a: "Then we will go and take it"
 dvg_opstalia.5.b: "We can't waste our resources over a stretch of desert"

 #vryland accepts
 dvg_opstalia.6.t: "Vryland accepts!"
 dvg_opstalia.6.d: "The president of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VRY').GetName] has agreed to negotiate a new border between us"
 dvg_opstalia.6.f: "This new border extends our control over all geuzen settlements north of the Oranje river."
 dvg_opstalia.6.a: "Its seems they do understand the concept of property ownership"

 #fate of the bastaards
 dvg_opstalia.7.t: "Fate of the Bastaards"
 dvg_opstalia.7.d: "We have recaptured thousands of fugitive slaves as well as many of the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_VRY').GetAdjective] that facilitated their escape"
 dvg_opstalia.7.f: "The obvious plan is to construct new farms and plantations in vryland to put them to work. However; immediatley putting them to work may simply create another slave revolt further down the line. Establishing an autonomous area should keep them quiet enough to be integrated down the line."
 dvg_opstalia.7.a: "Keep the entire territory"
 dvg_opstalia.7.b: "Establish an autonomous area"

 #hendrik returns
 dvg_opstalia.8.t: "Hendrik's Return"
 dvg_opstalia.8.d: "The time has come"
 dvg_opstalia.8.f: "Our army is as ready as it will ever be, our troops are armed, drilled and are performing manouvers at the border with [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_NFL').GetName]. They await the order to cross the border. "
 dvg_opstalia.8.a: "To Niew Antwerpen!"
 dvg_opstalia.8.b: "We aren't ready..."

 #hendrik gets fucked
 dvg_opstalia.9.t: "The Treaty"
 dvg_opstalia.9.d: "Today we signed a truce with [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_NFL').GetName] among the other concessions; we were forced to publicly renounce our claims to the government of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_NFL').GetName]."
 dvg_opstalia.9.f: "Back in Diericksdadt, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('kommandos_ig').GetName] have already gained some control. It is unlikley that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] will be able to show his face in [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_OPS').GetName] again, and will fade into irrelevance."
 dvg_opstalia.9.a: "So this is how it ends..."

 #death of Hendrik
 dvg_opstalia.10.t: "The Death of Hendrik"
 dvg_opstalia.10.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]; leader of the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_NFL').GetName] government in exile; is dead."
 dvg_opstalia.10.f: "This leaves the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('grondraad_ig').GetName] in a precarious position. They were only accepted into our country with the understanding that they would enable us to extend our influence to the Eastern Cape. With [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] gone they have lost the support of the people as well as local politicians. They are currently convening to elect a new Hoofkommandant from among themselves. Although removing them from power and returing leadership to the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('kommandos_ig').GetName] would be a simple matter."
 dvg_opstalia.10.a: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('kommandos_ig').GetName] return to power"
 dvg_opstalia.10.b: "We will accept the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('grondraad_ig').GetName]'s choice"

 #fate of the grondraad
 dvg_opstalia.11.t: "Fate of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('grondraad_ig').GetName]"
 dvg_opstalia.11.d: "Now that the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('kommandos_ig').GetName] are back in power we still need to decide what to do with the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('grondraad_ig').GetName]"
 dvg_opstalia.11.f: "The simplest option would be to allow them to retire to their plantations where they can remain out of political life. Though this leaves us with the possibilty of their continued meddling in our political shpere. Advisors close to the Hoofkommandant have proposed two options to deal with this: keep the remaining [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('grondraad_ig').GetName] members under house arrest (they are technically traitors for calling an unauthorised election), until we are certain they won't be a threat. Or we can arrest them and hand them over to [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_NFL').GetName], easing tensions and potentially opening up relations"
 dvg_opstalia.11.a: "Let them retire"
 dvg_opstalia.11.b: "Keep them under house arrest"
 dvg_opstalia.11.c: "We have no need for them anymore, send them back to [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_NFL').GetName]"

 #hendrik returns
 dvg_opstalia.12.t: "Return of the Hoofkommandant"
 dvg_opstalia.12.d: "The Republican Government of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_NFL').GetName] have appeared publically to officially announce their surrender and relinquish control of the government"
 dvg_opstalia.12.f: "As they were being escorted back to their cells, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] took the stage to declare [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_NFL').GetName]'s return to 'tradition, law and order'. Following the speech, the audience quickly returned to their homes. The steets have been eerily quiet ever since..."
 dvg_opstalia.12.a: "We return to the rule of law"
