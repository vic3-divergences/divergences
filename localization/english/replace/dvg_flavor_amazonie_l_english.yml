 dvg_amazonie.1.t: "The Federation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_amazonie.1.d: "As of 1836, we are the only independent and recognized 'democratic' republic on the continent unlike our neighbors to the south and north."
 dvg_amazonie.1.f: "Yet, that notion is contested as the slavery debate rages on in the country. Those in the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_EQX').GetName] in the west want to abolish slavery in all of the country, while most White Amazoniens in the east led by the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] would rather see its practice continue and not give up their power. For now, a compromise has been made with the Equinoxiens being under our sovereignty but handling their own domestic affairs, abolising slavery and giving their Black populace citizenship within their jurisdiction. While [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] does enable free elections to an extent, voting enfranchisement is largely wealth based and thus the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] have had an almost oligarchic hold on the country's politics. Still, it is thanks to them [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] managed to gain its independence peacefully, by paying off the Dual Monarchy with cash crops rather than go into armed conflict. "
 dvg_amazonie.1.a: "Good thing we're just a Republic, not a Democracy!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.2.t: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_amazonie.2.d: "As of 1836, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] are able to grant universal suffrage, abolish slavery, and recognize citizenship regardless of race."
 dvg_amazonie.2.f: "This is in stark contrast with the rest of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_AMA').GetName] which instead gives the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] a near-oligarchic hold on politics and is also considerably wealthier. Currently, we are allowed to practice our own laws in autonomy thanks to the compromise reached with the Amazonien government. This compromise is not likely to last forever though, as the Equinoxean laws and ideals might threaten the Planteur grip on power should they spread across [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_AMA').GetName]. Respectively, many Equinoxiens also hope to abolish slavery and enfranchise all of the populace in [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_AMA').GetName] and are willing to fight for it."
 dvg_amazonie.2.a: "We really are a democracy, not just a republic!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.3.t: "The Brésilvilles"
 dvg_amazonie.3.d: "Some free Black Amazoniens have managed to garner enough of their own wealth to build their own towns as part of their own philanthropic efforts."
 dvg_amazonie.3.f: "Often, these towns have come to be known as 'Brésilvilles', based on the wood used to build them. As most institutions in Amazonie follow a racial segregation policy, these towns have become a place to provide basic resources and services to Black Amazoniens, whether they immigrated here, were born free, or were former slaves. This has drawn the ire of White Planteurs who allege that some of their own slaves are escaping to these 'Brésilvilles' and are taking away land that should have been entitled to. Since we are a country that values private ownership, the legality of these towns have come into question."
 dvg_amazonie.3.a: "There is no issue for doing whatever you can with your money."
 dvg_amazonie.3.b: "This is a threat to Amazonien land and [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName]' property." 

 dvg_amazonie.4.t: "The Planteurs' Insurrection"
 dvg_amazonie.4.d: "Angered by our efforts to abolish slavery and unwilling to compromise on their power, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] have formed their own breakaway state in the form of "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_AMA').GetName]."
 dvg_amazonie.4.f: "Accordingly, they have managed to convince other White Amazoniens in the east of the country that the abolition of slavery is also a threat to their social status as well, and now many of these reactionaries are seeking to overthrow the government and restore the old Amazonien laws. However, since our politics have become more in-line with what the Equinoxiens have wanted, western [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] shoulld still be under our control with troops still loyal to the government."
 dvg_amazonie.4.a: "While they to bring men to chains, we will fight to keep men free!"
 dvg_amazonie.4.b: "God save the Antarctiques!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.5.t: "The Integration Of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_amazonie.5.d: "As our two governments expires, the government of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_AMA').GetName] have requested that our current laws regarding land ownership and slavery conform to their standards or else they will use military force to remove our government from power."
 dvg_amazonie.5.f: ""Whereas slavery, throughout its entire existence on the Amerigan continent, is none other than the most barbarous, unprovoked and unjustifiable war of one portion of its citizens against another portion, the only conditions of which are perpetual imprisonment and hopeless servitude, or absolute extermination, in utter disregard and violation of those eternal and self-evident truths in the human rights as our lord and savior would have wanted us to all value." - [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]"
 dvg_amazonie.5.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] shall not go down without a fight!"
 dvg_amazonie.5.b: "If Black Amazoniens can be free, then we can rejoin peacefully!"
 dvg_amazonie.5.c: "ahd henceforth...we shall bring salvation to ALL of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_AMA').GetName]!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.6.t: "Equinoxiens Refuse Integration!"
 dvg_amazonie.6.d: "The zealous insurgent group, now calling themselves the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_AMA').GetName], have refused our demands for their integration with our laws and have announced their intention to take up arms against our country."
 dvg_amazonie.6.f: ""Every one must understand that, whatever you say of slavery, it is not increased by its diffusion. Every one familiar with it knows that it is in proportion to its sparseness that it becomes less objectionable. Wherever there is an immediate connexion between the master and slave, whatever there is of harshness in the system is diminished. Such is analgous to the state and its federation. A house divided against its pillars cannot stand, a master divided against their slave cannot stand,and a federation divided its state cannot stand." - [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]"
 dvg_amazonie.6.a: "..and we refuse their refusal!"
 dvg_amazonie.6.b: "Let's just keep the status quo."
 
 dvg_amazonie.7.t: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_AMA').GetName] Passes the Fugitive Repatriation Act"
 dvg_amazonie.7.d: "Since [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_AMA').GetName] allows slavery but we have abolished it, many runaway slaves and outlaws from there have fled to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to start new lives. Now, [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_AMA').GetName] is threatening military force if we do not abide by their demands in accordance with their recent passage of their Fugitive Repatration Act."
 dvg_amazonie.7.f: "Under this new law, [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_AMA').GetName] is treating [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] as if it is under their sovereignty. Currently, our policy has been to welcome these runaway slaves and recognize them as citizens of our country. Many of these ex-slaves have gone on to become essential workers, build up their own wealth, and even become entrepeneurs or become educated professionals thanks to our policies. To return them back to Amazonien captivity would be a betrayal of our liberal ideals and admitting that Amazonien laws apply here, undermining our sovereignty. However, is this all worth risking a possible war at our front doorstep?"
 dvg_amazonie.7.a: "We shall always defend the liberty of our citizens and those who immigrate to our country, regardless of their origin!"
 dvg_amazonie.7.b: "It is best we avoid violence and preserve our existence regardless of the circumstances."
 
 dvg_amazonie.8.t: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ATL').GetName] Refuses To Return Fugitives"
 dvg_amazonie.8.d: "Claiming they will defend their sovereignty and citizens, the Atlantians have decided against allowing the extradition of any former Amazonien slaves or anyone else we consider to be outlaws within their territory."
 dvg_amazonie.8.f: "Clearly, the Atlantians do not care to respect our authority. Since slaves are considered property under Amazonien law, invading them is simply us trying to take back our lost property that has been stolen by these liberals who are only a bad influence on our people."
 dvg_amazonie.8.a: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ATL').GetName] was once Amazonien territory and it shall be again!"
 dvg_amazonie.8.b: "Well, we were never that serious about our demands anyway."
 
 dvg_amazonie.9.t: "The Integration of Equinoxea"
 dvg_amazonie.9.d: "As our troops march into Vaura, we have been able to restore order to our country."
 dvg_amazonie.9.f: "The Equinoxiens could have surrendered without a fight, but they chose to resist the inevitable. Now, the question still remains on how we should deal with the Equinoxien politicians now that their attempt of seperatism has been defeated. Granting them amnesty would anger the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName]."
 dvg_amazonie.9.a: "They shall be granted amnesty."
 dvg_amazonie.9.b: "Traitors must die!"
 dvg_amazonie.9.c: "Screw this country, I wanna find a new home!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.10.t: "Pará Seized"
 dvg_amazonie.10.d: "Pará has been seized by [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_AMA').GetName]."
 dvg_amazonie.10.f: "The Amazoniens to our south have taken advantage of us being at war to take the state of Pará from our control."
 dvg_amazonie.10.a: "We will get our state back!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.11.t: "The Brésilien Secession"
 dvg_amazonie.11.d: "A group of Afro-Amerigans calling themselves the Brésiliens after the Brésilvilles, have decided to declare their independence."
 dvg_amazonie.11.f: "Believing there is no hope for them the way our country is currently going, the Brésilvilles have decided to unite and form their own independent nation."
 dvg_amazonie.11.a: "Traitors!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.12.t: "Liberty for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_amazonie.12.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was able to stamp out slavery peacefully and integrate the Afro-Amerigan population without much unrest. "
 dvg_amazonie.12.f: "This might have angered the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName], but thanks to their diminished influence they were not able to cause much trouble."
 dvg_amazonie.12.a: "All men are created equal!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.13.t: "The Failure of Reconciliation"
 dvg_amazonie.13.d: "Despite the efforts of Reconciliation, it seems a united Amazonie was just not meant to be."
 dvg_amazonie.13.f: " There is saying -" Liberty is inevitable, albeit late.""
 dvg_amazonie.13.a: "Insurrection, again?"
 
 dvg_amazonie.14.t: "Dealing with the Brésiliens"
 dvg_amazonie.14.d: "Over time, some Afro-Amerigans have gained enough wealth to build themselves their own villages called 'Brésilvilles', with the inhabitants being known as 'Brésiliens.' "
 dvg_amazonie.14.f: "However, it has been brought back into question once more on how to deal with these villages now they have relocated into the Amazon jungle. Are we going to let them do as they please on land that we claim, or will we teach them a lesson?"
 dvg_amazonie.14.a: "The Amazon belongs to the Amazoniens!"
 dvg_amazonie.14.b: "Let's leave them be."
 
 dvg_amazonie.15.t: "The Brésilien Class"
 dvg_amazonie.15.d: "Thanks to us allowing the Brésiliens to continue their community-building efforts, they have become more influential within Amazonie."
 dvg_amazonie.15.f: "By being able to coalesce together, they are now able to band together to build political momentum to become an interest group with some clout."
 dvg_amazonie.15.a: "The Brésiliens are welcome to advocate for their interests in our capitol whenever."
 dvg_amazonie.15.b: "This is a threat to Amazonie. We should deny them any political influence."

 dvg_amazonie.16.t: "Post-Equinoxea Land Policy"
 dvg_amazonie.16.d: "Following the re-intergration of the Equinoxien states, the question on what the federal land policy should be has been brought up."
 dvg_amazonie.16.f: "Given how unsettled the region was, most Afro-Amerigans and Amazoniens followed a homesteading policy. However, with many of them now having been disenfranchised following the war, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] see this as an oppurtunity to expand their holdings through a nationwide tenant farming policy."
 dvg_amazonie.16.a: "We beat the Equinoxiens with [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] might, and therefore the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] shall be rewarded."
 dvg_amazonie.16.b: "Let the ex-rebels keep their land, hopefully they will calm down." 

 dvg_amazonie.17.t: "The Secluded Haven of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_amazonie.17.d: "A group of Afro-Amerigans managed to escape Amazonie's integration of Equinoxea, and re-establish their own safe haven deeper in the jungle."
 dvg_amazonie.17.f: "Far away from any recognized country, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is currently one of the last refuges for Afro-Amerigans hoping to escape the clutches of slavery in a place where they can be the ones in charge."
 dvg_amazonie.17.a: "Hopefully we can survive!" 

 dvg_amazonie.18.t: "Recognition of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Independence"
 dvg_amazonie.18.d: "Although much of the world has seen us as uncivilized savages, our might has proven to them that we are a force to be reckoned with."
 dvg_amazonie.18.f: "To many, the Amazonien civil war that of racial tensions between the White and Black populace, but the end result was the resurgence of the continent's original Tupi inhabitants."
 dvg_amazonie.18.a: "A great leap for the prosperity of Ameriga's indigenous!"   
 
 dvg_amazonie.19.t: "Victory for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_amazonie.19.d: "Despite the Equinoxien and Amazonien efforts, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] stands strong and free!"
 dvg_amazonie.19.f: "As such, we have stayed loyal to what the founding fathers of Amazonie wanted. God truly has saved [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. God bless the true Amazoniens, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName]! \n\n Our victory has upset may have upset some Afro-Amerigans and caused them to flee to neighboring countries, but who needs them anyway?"
 dvg_amazonie.19.a: "Vive [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]!"  
 
 dvg_amazonie.20.t: "The Amazonien Debt"
 dvg_amazonie.20.d: "Now that the old Amazonien regime no longer exists as we have successfully liberated it, it seems [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] may have inherited one of its biggest issues."
 dvg_amazonie.20.f: "To secure its independence and maintain power, the Planteurs of Amazonie promised to pay off the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_DUA').GetName]. However, many of those who fought alongside us, especially the Afro-Amerigans, are not fond of the idea of continuing the legacy of the slave owners and their country. We could just not pay off the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_DUA').GetName] since we are not the same country as what was once here. The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_DUA').GetName] might not see things the same way though."
 dvg_amazonie.20.a: "Our war against Amazonie was already difficult enough. We can't afford another war with an even stronger country"
 dvg_amazonie.20.b: "We are not Planteurs! We owe nothing!"
 
 dvg_amazonie.21.t: "Amazoniens Refuse to Pay Debts!"
 dvg_amazonie.21.d: "To secure their independence and recognize them, the Amazoniens has promised to pay us off. Now, their sucessor regime in [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_EQX').GetName] is refusing to finish up the payments."
 dvg_amazonie.21.f: "As this technically does mean they are reneging on their agreement with us over there, this can be our chance to seize their land like any lender would do with an indebted borrower who won't pay back what they owe."
 dvg_amazonie.21.a: "What's that? Free real estate in the Amazon?"
 dvg_amazonie.21.b: "Who cares what goes on down in Ameriga? We have more important matters to attend to."

 dvg_amazonie.22.t: "A Meeting in Port Sucre"
 dvg_amazonie.22.d: "Port-Sucre is the capital of the first Antarctican settlements in the North-East and the land has used slave labor since the XVIth century in sugar plantations. That’s where the power of the planter class is the strongest and where the abolitionist ideals are throwned upon by even the lower classes of white society."
 dvg_amazonie.22.f: "Nonetheless, an influential Senator and planteur François Barnave often qualified the true power in Antarctica received a delegation coming straight from [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ATL').GetName]. The informal meeting discussed the current political crisis related to slavery in the nation. Atlantians understood the economical consequences of abolition and thus pushed forward a plan where a freedom of womb law wiuld allow the gradual abolition while still benefiting the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] which would have a lifetime to plan for a society freed of slavery. But the delegation warned : the plan was already criticized in Equinoxia as it was and should it not pass in the Assembly the Atlantian Liberals would use ‘every means at their disposal’ to fight planters’ power."
 dvg_amazonie.22.a: "This is Amazonia, not Atlantia! They don't dictate laws here!"

 dvg_amazonie.23.t: "The Gouas Oath"
 dvg_amazonie.23.d: "Although the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] were wary of the seeming surge in liberal activity in the aftermath of the Abolition Bill’s failure none but the most paranoid of them had expected this latest turn of events."
 dvg_amazonie.23.f: "A coalition of liberals. many of them from [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ATL').GetName] have congregated in Gouas a region with growing amounts of abolitionist sentiments and issued a proclamation which affirms their absolute and unequivocal opposition to slavery and its supporters. However the document then goes on to declare that as the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] government “has proven neither able nor willing to uphold the natural rights of its people” the liberals have declared the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective]  regime of bondage and torture” illegitimate and have raised the flag of rebellion! Rallying under a reborn Equinoxia they seek nothing less than the overthrow of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]  and the installation of an abolitionist regime. Officers and regional governors are choosing sides and war is on the horizon."
 dvg_amazonie.23.a: "TRAITORS!"

 dvg_amazonie.24.t: "End of the Federation"
 dvg_amazonie.24.d: "Despite their fierce commitments to their ideals neither [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] nor [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_EQX').GetName] were able to gain a decisive advantage over the other."
 dvg_amazonie.24.f: " After a bitter peace of status quo was hammered out between the two nations the Abolitionniste coalition has splintered. [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_GOU').GetName] a mercurial ally at best saw no reason for further cooperation and has declared independence. Not only have the Abolitionnistes seemingly accepted this fait accompli but the sense of dispirit has spread. The [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ATL').GetAdjective]s having lost faith in [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_EQX').GetAdjective] leadership have followed [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_GOU').GetName] in declaring independence hoping to achieve their goals without having to work within another power. The greater [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_EQX').GetName] which the Abolitionnistes erected lies shattered reduced to its core territories as the coalition falls into infighting. Though [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is much reduced perhaps the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] have had the last laugh after all."
 dvg_amazonie.24.a: " Mon dieu, pourquoi m'as-tu abandonné!"

 dvg_amazonie.25.t: "The Victoire Convention"
 dvg_amazonie.25.d: "The situation in Gouas and Equinoxia is reaching a breaking point. Both states have begun to resist efforts by the federal government to rein them in or even to collect taxes in their states the former because of its well-connected and despotic governor and the latter because of its liberal opposition to slavery. "
 dvg_amazonie.25.f: "However, this has caused sufficient alarm as to compel moderates to seek a negotiated solution. Into this crisis has stepped  [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_ATL').GetName] who has convened a meeting in Victoire to discuss the issue. What they have proposed shocked our representatives : the granting of high levels of autonomy to Gouas and Equinoxia effectively making them internally sovereign states though we would control their foreign affairs. Many [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName] are outraged at this plan but a few have admitted that it may be the only way to prevent this situation from spiraling into war."
 dvg_amazonie.25.a: "If that is needed to preserve peace, so be it."
 dvg_amazonie.25.b: "Ridiculous! Leave the meeting at once we won't stand for this insult."

 dvg_amazonie.26.t: "The Victoire Protocol"
 dvg_amazonie.26.d: "Our efforts to secure a diplomatic solution to the Amazonian federalist crisis were successful. Gouas and Equinoxia have now become nearly sovereign but for the Amazonian overseers which remain to control their foreign affairs."
 dvg_amazonie.26.f: "Civil war has been prevented, but Amazonie is considerably weaker."
 dvg_amazonie.26.a: "Peace in our time."

 dvg_amazonie.27.t: "The Conseil Seizes Power"
 dvg_amazonie.27.d: "The continued machinations of Atlantia, Gouas, and Equinoxea coupled with the federal government’s apparent inability to respond has pushed the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('armed_forces_ig').GetName] into taking action."
 dvg_amazonie.27.f: "A cabal of generals and admirals proclaiming themselves to be the “defenders of the rule of law” have seized control of the government and “persuaded” the previous civilian authorities to appoint the conspirators to a military conseil to govern the nation instead. This news has been received particularly badly in Equinoxia where phrases like “ravishing of democracy” and “illegitimate takeover” have been bandied about. Perhaps it is well that the military is in control since now we shall probably have need of them."
 dvg_amazonie.27.a: "For order and stability!"

 dvg_amazonie.28.t: "Rumblings From Equinoxia"
 dvg_amazonie.28.d: "It is no secret that Equinoxia has been the center of dissent since the conseil took power much to the aggravation of our righteous leaders."
 dvg_amazonie.28.f: "While we have always known of their tendency towards troublemaking they are now embracing much more dangerous pursuits. It seems that earlier reports about Equinoxian militias were true as several policemen have discovered evidence of them drilling in the countryside. What’s more officers in Equinoxia have reported meetings of notable Equinoxians under cover of darkness in basements or on farms – meetings where firebrands preach the doctrine of secession. The conseil has understandably not taken this well and has ordered all such meetings broken up and anybody found to be attending them arrested. While our security personnel assure us that this will break the back of any anti-Amazonian conspiracies no matter how many meetings we disrupt they seem to be growing more frequent and numerous."
 dvg_amazonie.28.a: "Just keep it in the papers, it'll all blow over soon enough."

 dvg_amazonie.29.t: "The Equinoxian Secession"
 dvg_amazonie.29.d: "It seems that our raids on Equinoxian secessionist meetings and our attempts to track down the militias were for naught. This morning a proclamation was issued signed by regional officials from across Equinoxia denouncing the federal government as “the clawed hand of slaveocracy” and “the bludgeon of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planteurs_ig').GetName]” and repudiating their allegiance to the conseil."
 dvg_amazonie.29.f: "The Equinoxians “desiring an equitable government which rules by the consent of the governed and allows all men regardless of color to give or retract that consent to their representatives” have dissolved all ties with the federal government. This document is nothing less than articles of secession! Already Equinoxian military officers have rapidly defected to this rebellion which now stands poised to fight. The Equinoxean Insurgency has restarted in earnest."
 dvg_amazonie.29.a: "Crush the revolters!"

 dvg_amazonie.30.t: "The Gouas Plan"
 dvg_amazonie.30.d: "Our spies in Amazonia have confirmed that tensions at their highest between the Antarcticans and the Equinoxians. At any moment war could erupt between the two regions. While a tragedy it also gives us an opportunity."
 dvg_amazonie.30.f: "The region of Gouas is rich in lands and possibilities of industry and slavery doesn't hold as much power as it does in the North of Antarctica. Moreover the governor of the place is a greedy man that is thankfully full of debts. We could arrange a small bribe to him to consider an 'independence fight' under our protection of course."
 dvg_amazonie.30.a: "Contact our men in Gouas!"
 dvg_amazonie.30.b: "We are better than this."

 dvg_amazonie.31.t: "The Secession of Gouas"
 dvg_amazonie.31.d: "As if the secession of Equinoxia wasn’t bad enough now Gouas has also declared independence! Their governor has spouted various platitudes on “regional liberty” and “resisting federal tyranny” but we suspect a different motive to at play."
 dvg_amazonie.31.f: "While he has acted rather defiant in the past he is known to have expensive tastes and vast debts – and recently to have been in contact with Atlantian businessmen. Our domestic spies have confirmed that Goaus has gotten very friendly with Atlantia recently and all evidence points to this being nothing less than a plot to backstab us in our moment of weakness! We shall not forget this Atlantian intrigue but how should we deal with the problem in the short term?"
 dvg_amazonie.31.a: "We shall crush Gouas as well!"
 dvg_amazonie.31.b: "We must focus on Equinoxia for now"
 dvg_amazonie.31.c: "Libertas quæ sera tamen! (Liberty shall be delivered, albeit late)"

 dvg_amazonie.32.t: "Failure of the Victoire Convention"
 dvg_amazonie.32.d: "Our efforts to secure a diplomatic solution to the Amazonian federalist crisis were unsuccessful. The Amazonians were suspicious of us even before the meeting began."
 dvg_amazonie.32.f: "When our representative explained the proposal for Antarctican and Equinoxian autonomy the Amazonians flew into a rage. Denouncing us as “a conclave of vultures and coyotes” and “a den of scavengers" they left the conference with haste and the crestfallen Argentin and Equinoxian delegates soon followed."
 dvg_amazonie.32.a: "Was it something that we said?"
