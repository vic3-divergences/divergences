 GENERIC_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Elisabethean era is an age of industry and exploitation, of revolution and reaction. What new challenges will the times bring?"
 REV_GENERIC_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Dissatisfied with the direction that the so-called organized government was taking, these revolutionaries have decided to take up arms to overthrow it. Will they succeed in seizing power or will they be crushed like so many forgotten revolutions of the past?"
 DECENTRALIZED_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Encroached upon by more organized powers, this country struggles to maintain their autonomy. Will they see the dawn of a new century, or will their name survive only in history books?"

 #Ameriga
 PLU_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Golden Age of Piracy in [concept_dvg_ameriga] saw several Breton sailors turn to piracy due of the suffering they endured on colonial ships. Infamous among them was Barba-Du, or Blackbeard, who went on to raid several Spanish colonies. In the 17th century, facing increased repression from punitive fleets, pirates and smugglers sailed the Amazon River to escape colonial authorities. There they established an outpost among the Manao people, later becoming the city of Ploumanao, which became known as a refuge for adventurers and criminals, free and subject to no authority."
 TUP_FLAVOR_TEXT: "At the western border of Equinoxea is the Xingu River, known to the [concept_dvg_jesuit] as the 'gateway to the Amazon'. Possessing fertile land and diverse fauna and flora, the Xingu basin is home to an expansive network of indigenous polities of Jê origin, as well as Tupi peoples displaced from the eastern coast, which subsist largely on their own."
 GNI_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Living in the harsh and unforgiving environment of the Chaco (meaning 'land of the hunt' in [concept_dvg_quechua]), the Ava Guarani are known as fierce nomadic raiders, distinct from their relatives, the Mbyá Guarani who live off of farming and commerce east of the Paraguay River. Having waged several wars against both Incan and Lotharian encroachment, the warriors of the Chaco intend to preserve their independence at any cost."
 MUR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Deep Amazon is home to several indigenous groups, including the Ticuna majority as well as those of Arauaqui and Karib descent, who were once organized into a complex system of warring fiefdoms led by landed nobility, but who experienced major societal collapse as a result of colonial wars and disease. Though relations between the Incans and the locals were often less than amicable, frequent in the region is the sight of the [concept_dvg_chaski], Incan messengers and scouts who supply warbands with arms and resources to resist European encroachment."
 YNM_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Yanomami people form the majority in the North Amazon, inhabiting the region along with several peoples of Karib descent. Though they occupy the Amazon Basin, Mount Roraima, the sacred green mountain of the Makuxi people, allows safe transit through the northern border, a fact that Granadan colonists have taken advantage of in order to evangelize the peoples of the region as well as exploit its natural resources."
 TWT_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Also known as the [concept_dvg_incan_empire], Tawantinsuyu survived the European conquest of [concept_dvg_ameriga], and keeps its culture and traditions intact, though its position on the world stage is fragile. As the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire] falls apart and the continent grows more volatile than ever, the Realm of the Four Corners must fulfill its grand destiny, or die trying."
 WLM_FLAVOR_TEXT: "West of the Andes, the native [concept_dvg_mapuche] people have organized into a centralized confederation led by a Toki, meaning 'axe-bearer', in order to resist Incan and Euro-Amerigan encroachment."
 PAT_FLAVOR_TEXT: "East of the Andes, the native [concept_dvg_mapuche] people remain divided into several tribes, each led by a regional chief known as a Lonko. Though they have so far survived, assaults from the Beornian settlers in the north and calls for unification from the west increasingly threaten the Patagonians' traditional way of life."
 EQX_FLAVOR_TEXT: "After years of conflict as a militant abolitionist group led by the [concept_dvg_jesuit], the people known as the Equinoxiens have reached a compromise with the Amazonien government to rejoin the country as an autonomy, though abolition and censitary suffrage are to be considered legal west of the Monts-Diamants. This situation, referred to as the 'house divided', has increasingly inflammed tensions in northeastern Ameriga, and no one knows how much longer peace will last." 
 AMA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Priding itself on being the first recognized democratic country in [concept_dvg_ameriga], Amazonie portrays itself as a beacon of liberty in the New World. Nonetheless, the country is still firmly under the control of the [concept_dvg_planteur] and struggles to deal with the 'peculiar institution' of chattel slavery which sustains its economy and permeates its social fabric." 
 BEO_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Beornia was founded by English settlers who travelled to [concept_dvg_ameriga] seeking to preserve their culture, far from the influence of the [concept_dod_anglois]. Being mostly agrarian, remote, and sparsely populated, it is not a particularly well-known country. Among those who are aware of its existence, it is seen as an underdeveloped backwater. However, the recently-crowned King Edward seeks to change this sordid state of affairs, proclaiming himself the harbinger of the Beornian Golden Age."
 ATL_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Once a neglected borderland between Amazonie and Lotharingia, the discovery of gold in Atlantia made it a highly-disputed territory. After several conflicts, it now exists as a neutral buffer state controlled by the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire]. As the gold mines deplete however, there are growing calls for Atlantians to be able to determine their own future." 
 LOT_FLAVOR_TEXT: "After gaining its independence from [concept_dvg_burgundy], the state of Lotharingia fell into a brutal civil war between the Fédéralistes and Unitaires. After years of conflict, the charismatic colonel Denis de Aigle managed to lead his faction to victory, establishing a personalistic dictatorship. Will the 'army with a state' of the National Liberateurs hold to become a shining example for its neighbors, or is it doomed to collapse from corruption and nepotism?"
 QUI_FLAVOR_TEXT: "New Toledo is something of an esoteric state, especially compared to its neighbors in New Granada. With the inability of the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire] to conquer Cuzco, the Northern Andes have become a land of perpetual conflict, where the Spanish Crown relies heavily on support from the [concept_dvg_chimu] lords to retain its presence.\n\nThough revolutionaries in the city of Quito attempted to join their Granadan counterparts during the [concept_dvg_fifth_andine_war], they were quickly overwhelmed. Thanks to the efforts of Dom Henrique Túpac, colonial rule was restored, though there are some who claim the governor holds a great ambition..."
 GRA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Seven years ago, the valiant [concept_dvg_de_herrera] made his stand against the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire] and declared the Independence of New Granada. Yet betrayal by his once-trusted comrades and intervention by the savage Incans resulted in his death during the [concept_dvg_fifth_andine_war], and Granada fell under the throes of empire once more.\n\nNow, years later, the Herrerists continue to organize rebellion in the hinterlands, with guerilla leader Guillermo de Blanco swearing to uphold his late leader's legacy. And as the Colombian Alliance mobilizes in the north, the Herrerian Revolution is sure to follow suit."
 THL_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Living in the southern reaches of Patagonia, the Aónikenk, also known as Tehuelches, are a nomadic people who have undergone a process of 'Araucanization', adopting several cultural traits and societal conventions from the western [concept_dvg_mapuche]."
 KAW_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Kaweskar, along with the near-extinct Cunco and Chono, are nomadic seafaring peoples who inhabit the southern reaches of Araucania, living off of fishing and using canoes as their primary mean of transportation."
 SLK_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Selk'nam, along with the Manek'enk and Yahgan, are nomadic peoples who live in the far south of the Amerigan continent, having still gone near-entirely uncontacted by European explorers, though it was the sight of their bonfires which gave the region its name of Tierra del Fuego."

 #Arcadia
 QIN_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Federation of Qingqiu, is a nation birthed from tales of Ming ships sailing across an endless sea, from undying loyalty to cities as they burn to the ground, untold riches under sunburnt hills, and the endurance of a mighty populace. Following the Rebellion of 1818 against the Empire of [concept_dvg_japan], Qingqiu finds itself looking inwards as the world outside demands change - the Elisabethian Era may be one of strife or one of prosperity for the nation, though it will surely be remembered."
 VIN_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Vinland, a colony of [concept_dvg_scandinavia] in the far north of [concept_dvg_arcadia], has been largely dormant, towing the Scandinavian line. Or at least that is how it would appear, with discontent brewing among the Vinlandic and Masgirlandic populations, the expansive colonies may become more trouble than they're worth. However, as a young state is a fragile one, will Vinland be able to break its Scandinavian chains and survive as a free nation in Arcadia?"
 MSG_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Masgirland is a smaller albeit wealthy colony of [concept_dvg_scandinavia] to the south of Vinland. Despite having similar aspirations of independence, this sister-state may seek instead to tread a different path. Will Masgirland manage to hold firm on its own against both the Scandinavians and Vinlanders?"
 PLA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The region of Southeastern [concept_dvg_arcadia] was first colonized by French settlers from the [concept_dvg_dual_monarchy], proving to be a highly-profitable domain sustained by the slave trade and a plantation economy. Following a succession dispute for the Plantagenat throne, the colony became an independent kingdom governed by a Plantagenat cadet branch, though it distanced itself from its former overlords, instead approaching [concept_dvg_burgundy].\n\nAs the first independent state in the New World, the Plantagenian monarchs eventually laid claim to all of Arcadia, though the Arcadian Empire was ultimately dismantled following intervention by [concept_dvg_scandinavia] and the Glorious Belgian Revolution. Can the Arcadian Empire be restored?"
 GCO_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Gran Colombia's recent declaration of independence from the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire] has sent tremors throughout the New World. With Spanish power waning in Granada and Quito in open revolt, Gran Colombia is well poised to position itself as one of the world's greatest powers. However, should it fail to bring revolution southwards, the 'Colombian Dream' may very well disappear, as Lusitanians and Salvadorans alike demand their own countries."
 BELGIAN_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Belgian Confederacy is the most industrialized nation in [concept_dvg_arcadia], holding vast quantities of iron and coal. Originally a Burgundian colony, the Seven Republics broke free during the Glorious Belgian Revolution, forming a state led by [concept_dvg_enlightenment] ideals. What does the future hold for them?"

 SKR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Established by Scandinavian colonial authorities as a buffer zone, the Skraelingr territory sits on land that is coveted by its White neighbors. Already having facing internal struggles over tribal differences, it would be an uphill battle for this entity to become a recognizable power in its own right."

 CHE_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Recognized only by the already divisive Plantagenian monarchy, this Cherokee nation has so far been able to resist the machinations of the increasing settler population surrounding it as it sits on land with resources in demand by the increasingly industrial age."

 ATH_FLAVOR_TEXT: "A vestige of the age of exploration, the Venetian overlords of this cash crop colony question whether holding onto this land is worthwhile as it is sought out by Arcadian powers for its strategic importance."

 DUA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Ruled by the Plantagenet Dynasty ever since their victory in the [concept_dvg_hundred_years_war], the [concept_dvg_dual_monarchy] is a union of two unequal partners. In the courts of Paris and Londres, the [concept_dod_anglois] boast great wealth and ambitions, but their myriad subjects across the lands of France and England are still subject to feudal restrictions and unstable governance. Though the country boasts a powerful economy, great cultural prestige, and a massive population, all of that could be for naught if the union fails to adapt to the Modern Age."
 BRG_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Once a mere duchy, subject to the authority of the French King, [concept_dvg_burgundy] broke free and formed its own state in the aftermath of the [concept_dvg_hundred_years_war]. Since then, it has grown to become one of the most powerful countries in Europe, embracing the Protestant Reformation and the Industrial Revolution and founding a modern nation-state.\n\nDespite this, the kingdom still faces several challenges, as its geographic position leaves it vulnerable should powerful states arise out of Germany and the [concept_dvg_dual_monarchy]. At the same time, its political scene hosts an unresolved conflict between the interests of the liberal Parliament and the conservative Aristocracy, heir to the struggles of the [concept_dvg_enlightenment]." 
 SCA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Formed from the Kalmar Union of the 16th century, [concept_dvg_scandinavia] managed to stabilize itself and eventually became a centralized nation. With a powerful navy and secure geographic position, it is able to pursue its interests across all corners of the globe, though the country also struggles with a low population and lack of arable land."
 SPA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Formed from of the union of the crowns of Portugal and Castille in the 15th century, the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire] was once an unmatched force, waging conquest and spreading Catholicism across all corners of the globe. Yet the centuries since their heyday have seen Spain fall into a deep decadence, as their political scene grows increasingly unstable, while their economy is almost entirely dependent on [concept_dod_anglois] investments. Now, the recent Colombian Revolution in Southern [concept_dvg_arcadia] may prove to be the last nail in Spain's coffin."
 ARN_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Crown of Aragon, instead of falling under a union with Castile, followed its own destiny and significantly expanded its Mediterranean holdings."
 PRO_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Kingdom of Provence is something of a haven for the lost royals of Europe, hosting both the Valois 'Kings-in-France' and the exiled Tuscan Medicis. Born out of the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_rome] which put an end to the [concept_dvg_hundred_years_war], its position as a French Catholic state in Protestant Occitania grows increasingly untenable.\n\nYet if Provence is able to beat the odds and triumph, it may just grow into a new European power. Between revanchist monarchs and ambitious generals, who knows what lays in store for the kingdom of the Alps?"
 ##Italy (add text for Etruria, Lombady, Parma, Modena, Papacy)
 SAV_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Savoy is one of the most powerful Italian states, with its nobility and the church centralizing power around themselves. Will this trend continue, or will a more liberal nation emerge?"
 GEN_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Genoa was once a great maritime and financial power, but those days are long gone. Now Genoa is a shadow of its former self, ruled by a so-called “Duke” who is far more concerned with funding his lavish lifestyle than managing the country. The curtain is calling, and unless something is done, Genoa will fade into the dust of history."
 VEN_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Venice, Queen of the Adriatic, stands at a crossroads as the winds of change blow from the East and West. The intervention in Greece during the Turkish Civil War gave Venice control of the Greek peninsula, a heartland that now eagerly calls for independence as the Turkish threat now lays far ashore. While to the West, the winds of Italian nationalism push the various remaining independent Italian states into a conflict that at any moment could crash upon Venice's shores. Will Venice be caught in the crosstides of history or will it survive and sail to ever greater heights."
 LUC_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Born as a concession to Provence, the Duchy of Lucca was carved from Tuscany and ceded by the Farnese. A cousin of the King-in-France was declared Duke by a "legitimist" uprising orchestrated by the Gonzaga government with the tacit approval of the Florentine government. The creation of the Duchy, not recognized by Provence, was meant to close the matter of Valois claims in Tuscany once and for all. The "Scapegoat Kingdom" did not reach its goals and the King in France continued to claim a region it will likely never control again. The original plan was for Provence to relinquish all claims over Tuscany, followed by a similar move by Florence to renounce all claims outside of Tuscany. This did not happen due to the stubbornness of the King-in-France, causing instead a new wave of indignation and aggressiveness in Tuscany, putting at stake the life of the young Duchy and the fragile balance in the Peninsula."
 ##Holy Roman Empire
 BOH_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Bohemia is a grand nation, and its ruler is the only one in the west to hold the title of Emperor, as the leader of the [concept_dvg_holy_roman_empire] — or what is left of it. Ever since the wars of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], the empire has fallen into a weakened and decadent state, with petty lords constantly squabbling against each other. Despite it all, Bohemia remains a powerful nation and the undisputed ruler of Central Europe, though its future is uncertain."
 AUS_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Archduchy of Austria has been dealt a terrible hand in recent history: siding thrice with the losing factions during the wars of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], and surrendering to their political archnemesis Bavaria in the signing of the [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris] in 1820, Austria has been dismantled into a rump state. Isolated by geography and diplomacy, its influence upon the other Danubian states is limited, though a large percentage of the population, inspired by Marinus Dahlke's victory against the Wittelsbachs, still hope for German unification."
 BAV_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Kingdom of Bavaria is perhaps the only real winner of the [concept_dvg_german_revolution], having confirmed its territorial gains against Austria in the 1820 [concept_dvg_treaty_of_paris]. Perhaps because of this, the country maintains one of the most organized factions of Radicalists in Germany, constantly agitating against aristocratic privilege and for national unification.\n\nIf Bavaria can manage its affairs and write a balanced constitution, then the path towards a United Germany lays straight ahead. However, if the kingdom fails to stabilize, it will become little more than a rump state, having lost its golden opportunity."
 BEG_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Berg is a minor Rhenish nation under Burgundian influence. The duke has ambitions to unify the Rhenish states under a confederation."
 SWI_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Confederacy proudly stands as an enduring alliance of cantons composed of various entities. Despite their nominally independent status, they are considered associates with their historically amicable ties with Zurich. Many liberals in the Tagsatzung have argued that a Swiss identity is the solution to mend the wounds of our state. The Swiss must live up to their destiny and best their rivals through wit or by force, lest they succumb to the whims of Great Powers or German upstarts in the region."

 ##Commonwealth (add Prussia, Lithuania, Moldavia)
 POL_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Known as the 'Sick Man of Europe', the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is a prestigious and venerable state with little left to its name. Suffering from widespread corruption and a paralyzed Sejm, Polish power over the east will surely collapse if drastic measures are not taken, and the Commonwealth may even cease to exist entirely."
 KIE_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Uman Confederation is a union of East Slavic tribes who are united by a common desire for independence and self-rule. Will they be able to succeed and form Ruthenia?"
 KHK_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Recent years have seen the Western Pontic Steppe enjoy an era of relative peace, especially after the violence and destruction seen in the 17th and 18th centuries during the Wars of the Wild Fields. Though border raids still occur, their frequency has diminshed considerably. Yet the Cossacks still hold great ambitions of a unified Hetmanate, teaching freedom to the Magnates and Boyars."
 ZAZ_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Recent years have seen the Western Pontic Steppe enjoy an era of relative peace, especially after the violence and destruction seen in the 17th and 18th centuries during the Wars of the Wild Fields.

 ##Rus
 MSO_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Lyapunov Principality of Moscow is the rising star of Central Russia. The country has recently celebrated a victory against Yaroslavl, and increased its influence over the Smolensk nobility to the west. The current ruler, Peter III Lyapunov has been married to the daughter of Maximillian Habsburg, ruler of the Commonwealth, under the auspices of the philo-polish Boyars. But though some deride this union as a return to Polish dominance, it seems the balance of power is shifting in Moscow' favor."
 TVE_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Belsky Principality of Yaroslavl is the gate between Central Russia and the North, inheriting significant cultural and economic influences from Novgorod and [concept_dvg_scandinavia]. After a recent defeat against Moscow, the Boyars were forced to abolish Serfdom, narrowly avoiding a republican revolution."
 RYA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Repnin Principality of Ryazan is the gate between Central Russia and the South, having a significant Cossack population and an alliance with the Voronezh Host. Uniquely among the states of Rus, the influence of liberal elements in the Armed Forces has led to the adoption of a constitutional mode of government, aiming to create a synthesis between the values of Europe and the Steppes."
 NZH_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The succession of the Principality of Nizhny Novgorod is one of the great questions agitating Central Russia. The current prince, Alexey, is the brother-in-law of the Prince of Moscow through his wife, as well as cousin to the Prince of Yaroslav. Having produced no offspring despite being married for a decade, both Moscow and Tver seek to take over the petty realm."
 SMO_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Kropotkin Principality of Smolensk is the result of many contentions between the states of Rus and the Commonwealth. Since the peace treaty that ended the Yaroslavl-Polish War, Smolensk has been part of the Polish sphere, and has increasingly adopted liberal means of governance, including the abolition of serfdom and constitutionalism. Despite this, the other principalities do not regard it as a legitimate state, and seek to annex it."
 NOV_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Novgorod is a confederation of various states, princedoms, and republics swearing fealty to 'Lord Novgorod the Great', that is, the city of Veliky Novgorod and its institutions. The republic has suffered a terrible blow with the loss of the Pskov, reorganized as a satellite state to [concept_dvg_scandinavia] following the [concept_dvg_neva_war] in 1709. Now, the republic stands at a crossroads: in order to survive, it must centralize and reform its institutions, yet this will necessarily bring it into civil conflict with the princedoms within its borders, which will seek to defend their ancient privileges. Will Novgorod wear the mantle of [concept_dvg_alexander_nevsky] and lead Russia towards a new era, perish by the Scandinavian boot, or suffocate under its own weight?"
 BLO_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Beloozero Principality is a principality under the Novgorod confederation."
 UGG_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Galich Principality is a principality under the Novgorod confederation."
 VYA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Vyatka Republic is a constituent member of the Novgorod confederation, but many of its inhabitants are not Slavs, but rather Uralic people who are discriminated against by various Russian laws."

With the conquest of their lands by Hungary, discrimination and pogroms have led to the Revolt of the Bosniak Beys. Should the war be lost, the very fate of the Bosniak people in Hungary may be decided."
 SER_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Serbia is under the protection of Illyria, owing its independence from the Turks to the contributions of the Illyrian Army. Is there a future for a Serbian nation? Or is Serbia fated to join a Croation-Led Yugoslavia?"
 CRO_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Illyria is well poised to unite Yugoslavia, having taken Serbia from the Turks years prior. However, there are numerous powerful enemies in the way, and with no strong backer seeking a united South Slavic nation, it is up to the Illyrians themselves to guide the South Slavic people to union."
 MON_FLAVOR_TEXT: "After the Turks retreated from the Balkans, Serbia has come to re-take what would rightfully be its coastline. However, there is growing alienation from those inhabiting the black mountain, some of which who may see themselves closer to Venice or perhaps be their own nation alltogether."
 ALB_FLAVOR_TEXT: "In the collapse of Turkish rule, an upstart general and his loyal soldiers have managed to organize an independent Albanian state in Europe, often having to cooperate with both Turkish overlords and European seperatists as needed. However, this political manuevering may backfire as Albania now finds itself stuck between its populace wanting to reclaim more land and the country's neighbors wanting to stamp out the remnants of Islam's legacy on the continent."
 
 ###ASIA###
 #North-East Asia
 JAP_FLAVOR_TEXT: "In 1826, Shogun-Emperor Kōmei ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne. A reformer who did not realize the precarity of his reign, his attempt to abolish Samurai privileges led to a devastating civil war. Though the Imperial Faction ultimately won and the Emperor's agenda goes on, the Home Islands are devastated and imperial influence overseas has diminished greatly, particularly in Korea. Can [concept_dvg_japan] restore order?"
 KOR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Korea has only recently gained its independence from the Empire of [concept_dvg_japan], though tensions remain high and the new nation may soon find itself once more under the Japanese thrall."
 ##Steppes (Add Circassia and Georgian states)
 CRI_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The issue of succession has plagued the various Khanates of the Steppe ever since the times of Genghis Khan. Even Crimea, the most 'westernized' of them cannot escape this fate. Most of the time, the matter was decided on by the Turks who chose woever pleased them the most, however with their influence waning and the potential of a united Slavic threat, Crimea's future is in question."
 ASK_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Even if the Xacitarxani have been united in a single state, Kipchaks are still far from being a single people. Will the Xacitarxani's location between the Asian and European steppes prove to be to their advantage, or their undoing?"
 SBR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Khanate of Sibir is the northernmost Muslim state in the world, having long been the main obstacle of European expansion into the vast North Asian tundra. Should they manage to keep this up, perhaps these sparsely populated lands could become theirs at last?"
 BAK_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Bashkirs are Turco-Kipchak people who are said to inhabit some of the richest lands in the area, yet they are overshadowed by their more dominant neighbors. Will they be the ones to unite the Kipchaks, or just become a stepping stone for some other empire's ambitions?"
 IUS_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Founded around one of the most prosperous Kipchak cities, Kazan is one of the successor states of the Golden Horde, currently acting as a buffer state between the Slavs and the Mongols. Perhaps this new era can give them a greater role..."
 ##Middle East (Add Arabian Peninsula)
 IRQ_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Iraq is a small state in the Middle East, heir to the ancient Mesopotamian civilization as well as to great centers of Islamic learning. Being sandwiched between the Arab and Persian homelands, how will Iraq define itself?"
 TRC_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Upon the death of the last Timurid Emperor, Shah Rukh, the empire splintered into rivaling states — Babur Mirza in Khorasan, Ulugh Beg in Transoxiana, and Sultan Muhammad in Ajam. Babur thus recruited the Timurtash - a Turkmen tribe recognized for their martial might — to crush his rivals, with the Turkemn soon becoming a crucial element of his military forces. After defeating Ulugh Beg, who had been usurped by his own son, Babur placed him on the throne as a puppet Shah, before assuming the throne himself following his death. Though the Timurtash have survived to the modern day, they have done so little more than a rump state, and many wonder how much longer the dynasty can last."
 AZB_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Once a vassal of the Timurtash Empire ruling over a small domain in the Kura River Valley, Khalil Khan exploited the power vacuum left by the Timurtash collapse by conquering the petty khanates from Baku to Tabriz. Now divided between its Persian and Caucasian identities, the Shaki Khanate must decide on its path."
 TEH_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Kar-Kiya domains stretching along the Caspian Sea are isolated from the Iranian Plateau by the Alborz Mountains, something the Kiya Amirs have used to their advantage. In centuries past, Timur and his successors preferred to delegate rule of this remote region to their vassals. Upon the collapse of the Timurtash Empire, these Amirs achieved independence and even expanded south into the populous region of Ajam. Now, however, the recently ascended Rostam Kiya has inherited a decadent realm with a paralyzed bureaucracy, and must deal with religious unrest in Ajam as the Zaydi monarchy attempts to enforce its creed on a population split between Sunnism and the herectic Ismaili and Twelver sects of Shi'a Islam."
 SHZ_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Nomadism in the Zagros has its origins in the Mongol Invasion of Persia, when the destruction of the imperial irrigation systems forced the sedentary Kurds and Qashqai into migrational pastoralism. When the Timurtash Shahanshahs gained control over the region they could only exert limited authority over the Zagros tribes, relying on them for local administration and security of the western frontiers. Following the Timurtash collapse, Luristan was formally ceded to the Empire of [concept_dvg_rum], although not even the Sultan managed to control it — his expedition being crushed by a tribal coalition headed by the Shekbizin. The prestige from the victory against the Turks allowed the Shekbizin leader to crown himself Shah. Despite this, direct control by the crown remains fragile outside of the imperial core."
 AFG_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Karlani Shahdom represents a union of the Afghan tribes as a single nation, warding off the Timurtash, Sikhs, and Dzungars. Given its current position, their new leader, Akbar Durrani, seeks to expand his country's borders."

 MCH_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Manchus have attempted to invade the Chinese heartland for centuries, but have always been stopped by the holders of Beijing. Will persistence be the key to their success or should they set their ambitions elsewhere?"

 NAN_FLAVOR_TEXT: "After the Shun secured their hold on Northern China, the Ming loyalists fled to Taiwan, and Jiangxi slipped into a theocracy, a group of liberal-minded Chinese nobles in Nanjing decided to form their own republic instead of being governed by an emperor or zealot. This Wu Republic hopes to bring an end to these endless disputes over the Mandate of Heaven, but how will it do so?"

Despite these challenges, the company has a trade-focused economy with a rich culinary tradition."
 PLM_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Sumatra Agency is a subsidiary of the Compagnie des Indes Orientales, playing a vital role in the company's trade network.

 BAL_FLAVOR_TEXT: "After the Majapahit conquered Bali, they installed kings there and helped shape the island's culture. After the empire's collapse, what remained of the empire managed to survive on the island and mantain hegemony over the Sunda islands. Eventually, this resulted in a Balinese identity distinct from the other indies. Now in the Elisabethean era, the balance of power in the East Indies is once again shifting. Could this be the chance to unify the arcihpelago once more?"
 SUG_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Sandwiched between Chinese and European interests, the odds for Sugbu staying independent much longer might seem low.

#India
 MUG_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Mughal Empire is the most powerful state in India, hosting a massive population and controlling several valuable resources.

 #Zhourao and Oceania
 MJN_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Mianjin Republic is the centre — in all meanings of the word — of [concept_dod_zhourao]. Founded by Christian merchants from [concept_dvg_qingqiu], it developed tremendously in the 18th century with the arrival of thousands of Chinese settlers who fled war in Asia.\n\nThe republic has withstood assaults from the Red Sultans in the north and established several contacts with the [concept_dvg_maoli] tribes and secured naval trade routes while growing more and more into a proper Little China. However, the monopolistic rule of the patrician families provoked a miner's rebellion in the south, leading to the loss of several great towns and mines to the League of Yaluo. Mianjin now stands at a crossroads: can they emulate their brethern in Qingqiu to embrace modernity and unite the continent, or should the rule of the rich continue without any reform?"
 ZSA_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Sultanate of Zhusha is the oldest settlement in [concept_dod_zhourao], founded by a descendant of the Wali Songo. With a privileged position giving the Sultans control over Indonesian trade, Zhusha's economy prospered, while also ensuring the rapid spread of Islam, and giving rise to the Red Sultans, who pursued a continental mandate.\n\nHowever, all the attempts of the Red Sultans to conquer their southern neighbours have been unsuccessful and the court in Butingshan has grown decadent and increasingly reliant on the [concept_dod_anglois], always eager to expand their markets. Will the sultanate manage to shake the status quo, or will the Red Sultans continue to statgnate until they are mere puppets of colonial powers?"
 YLO_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Yaluo League is the youngest [concept_dod_zhourao] state, born from miners' rebellions against the oligarchy of Mianjin allied with local [concept_dod_hongshan] tribes. While its foundations are still shaky, the League gives hope to the people of the continent for it enshrines democracy and tolerance above all.\n\nTheir capital already attracts merchants from [concept_dvg_burgundy] and [concept_dvg_scandinavia], but many wonder if the latter intend on staying good trade partners, or if their colony of Vargø is only their first step to a wider colonization of the continent. Yaluo, unique in the continent, supports equal rights for [concept_dod_hongshan], a policy which inspires agitation and unrest in the north, and Mianjin's shadow looms greatly over the newly independent nation..."
 KOO_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Guli Confederation is a league of [concept_dod_hongshan] under the supervision of Yaluo, and fought with them to secure independence from Mianjin. However, now turmoil and reactionary political movements in Yaluo threaten to put an end to the independence of the confederation."
 YAL_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Though many have converted to Islam, the Yalai and other [concept_dod_hongshan] tribes of southern Jiangzhou have long been a thorn in the back of Zhusha, with raids being conducted on an almost yearly basis. However, recent years have seen an uptick in the scale and amount of these raids, and a proper intervention and war from Zhusha does not seem to be too far from the horizon. Time will tell, but it seems the [concept_dod_liushadi] shall be civilized in due time."
 WIR_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Kamilaluoyi, and the numerous other tribes of Ruisha, fought against Mianjin in the First Kongsi War, but refused to join the Guli Confederation out of fear of the end of their way of life, and have been fiercely resisting [concept_dod_zhourao] encroachment into the [concept_dod_liushadi] ever since."

 PJT_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The [concept_dod_hongshan] of the Tanami Desert have remained almost unaffected by the discovery of [concept_dod_zhourao]. However, European settlement has begun to encroach upon their lands."
 NNG_FLAVOR_TEXT: "European influence looms large, as many of the Noongar have converted to Protestantism, a consequence of missionairies and tribal elders looking to gain European weapons and support. The Noongar tribes are the most advanced of the decentralized areas of [concept_dod_zhourao], with them perhaps being only a few more decades from uniting into a confederation, similar to the Guli to the east. Despite this, the Burgundian colony in Cap Weltevree threatens to break them before they can reach such a point."
 YMT_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The [concept_dod_hongshan] surounding Carpenterie, the Burgundian colony under the [concept_dod_voc], have partially converted to Protestantism. Many more, however, respond the arrival of European and Indonesian coolies in the region with suspicion"
 YLN_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Yolngu Sultanate is best described as an empire, ruling over a diverse group of tribes, with power emanating from their seat of power in the east. They have become rich off of the trade of gold to the Makassarese in Kayu Jawa, and adopted Islam over the course of the four hundred years of contact since the discovery of [concept_dod_zhourao]. Well poised to unite the region, they have been stalled by the unification of the Marra, as well as the Wadjiginy Sultanate. Now, at the height of their power, [concept_dod_anglois] intervention threatens to spell doom for not only Yolngu, but all three states."
 NGL_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The Wadjiginy Sultanate has expanded gradually thanks to their trade with the Makassarese port of Kayu Jawa, however, they now are threatened by the rising Yolngu Sultanate, as well as [concept_dod_anglois] intervention into the region."
 GWG_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Northern [concept_dod_zhourao] is a highly-diverse region, with the influence of the Makassarese being felt at every level. Islam flows out of Kayu Jawa just as gold flows in. The Marra were once seperated into a myriad of tribes and sultanates, however, with the rise of the Yolngu Sultanate to their north, they have united under the rule of Sultans."
 AOT_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Aotearoa is a unified [concept_dvg_maoli] state on the North Island. That is, at least, its appearance. It would be more accurately described as a unification in name only, forced upon them by the [concept_dod_zhourao]. In the past, the introduction of gunpowder to the region resulted in the [concept_dod_musket_wars], from which the [concept_dvg_maoli] have only recently recovered. This has led the economic situation of the island to further rely on Mianjin, and the leasing of Yungang has exasperated the crisis. Will the [concept_dvg_maoli] manage to return themselves to independence, or are they doomed to fall under the thrall of foreign powers?"
 NTO_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Ngāi Tahu, or Tǎhú bù to the Chinese, is the largest [concept_dvg_maoli] iwi by area, though their population is relatively small. Additionally, numerous other iwis control sections of land in what is represented as Ngāi Tahu. Historically, they would merge together under the moniker of Ngāi Tahu, meaning the People of Tahu. Devastated by the [concept_dod_musket_war], their lands are now eyed greedily by [concept_dvg_scandinavia]. Though only time will tell, the near future of the people of Tahu does not appear bright."
 NTU_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Ngāti Koata, or Kētǎ bù to the Chinese, is one of many iwi in the northern tip of the South Island, having a large population concentrated in a small land area.

 FGH_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Upon being exiled from Qingqiu, the renowned admiral was placed in charge of a recently unified Hawaiian archipelago - creating a country known as Fang Hu. Although there are ambitions to make this an outpost of the greater Qingqiuan civilization, other colonial powers have their eyes on this strategic location alongside the indigenous islanders who wish to retake their country."

 LNG_FLAVOR_TEXT: "When missionaries from [concept_dvg_scandinavia] first landed in Mbanza-Kongo, the Kongolese monarchs were quick to adopt Protestantism, seeing it as a way to centralize the realm under their rule. Yet this caused discontent among their vassals, and the ensuing civil war forced the Kilukeni dynasty to seek refuge in neighboring Loango. Today, the Kingdom of Loango remains a close partner to the Scandinavians, dreaming of reconquering its capital from the hands of the Jaga barbarians."
 NDG_FLAVOR_TEXT: "When missionaries from [concept_dvg_scandinavia] first landed in Mbanza-Kongo, the Kongolese monarchs were quick to adopt Protestantism, seeing it as a way to centralize the realm under their rule. Yet this caused discontent among their vassals, particularly the southeastern states of Ndongo and Matamba. After a Scandinavian ambassador refused a demand to return Mbundu slaves who had been wrongfully taken captive, warrior-queen Ndongo Mutambu declared war on the Kilukeni dynasty, conquering their capital and signing peace with the Scandinavians in 1656, which saw the lands of the Congo Basin united under Great Ndongo."
 ##East Africa
 ETH_FLAVOR_TEXT: "During the 16th century dispute for control over the Red Sea, the [concept_dvg_spanish_empire] and the Turkish dynasty of [concept_dvg_rum] would each support a power in the Horn of Africa: the Christian Ethiopian Empire versus the Muslim Adal Sultanate. When the Ethiopians ultimately won, a long-standing alliance was formed between the Europeans and the realm of Prester John. Yet the conversion of Negus Fasilides I to Catholicism proved to be a controversial affair in the realm, and as underground groups agitate for the restoration of the Orthodox Church, this age of stability threatens to come to an end."

 OPS_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Opstalia is not a country in the traditional sense of the word, but rather an understanding between the various Geuzen Republics which have formed north of the Vaal River. While these republics are technically independent, de facto leadership falls to the most powerful settlement in the area, Dierickstadt"
 NFL_FLAVOR_TEXT: "The first of the Geuzen Republics to declare independence, Nuweflander has fought tyranny from both foreign and domestic aggressors alike. Watched by hungry eyes in [concept_dvg_burgundy] and Dierickstadt, their struggle for independence is far from over."
 VRY_FLAVOR_TEXT: "Founded by a mixed-race group of people known as the "Bastaards", Vryland stands as the only free republic reigon led by people of African descent.
