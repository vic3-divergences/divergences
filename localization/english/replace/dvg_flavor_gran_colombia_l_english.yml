 dvg_gran_colombia.1.t: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.1.d: "For centuries, Spain has ruled its colonies with the greed and heartlessness of an absentee landlord. The liberal King Jose II usurped the Spanish throne in 1808 and seemed willing to increase colonial trade and local elites’ power, but the Dual Monarchy backed the absolutist pretender Pedro III against Jose. After taking the throne in 1815 at the end of the brutal Peninsular War, Pedro issued the Petrine “Reforms”."
 dvg_gran_colombia.1.f: "The Reforms strangled domestic colonial trade and confirmed the status of European-born peninsulares as the colonial elite despite calls for local representation. The crushing of the revolutionary First Mexican Republic by Spain in 1817 lit the flame of independence throughout Spain’s colonies, who formed the Colombian Alliance, led by liberal Anastasio Vicente, to win their freedom. We are currently observing an armistice with Spain, but war may soon return. Some whisper of fractures within the Alliance, but so long as the Spanish crown still seeks to destroy us, we must unite for the sake of liberty!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.1.a: ""Independence!" shouts the New World: The land of Columbus is bathed in heroes' blood!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.2.t: "The Colombian War for Independence"
 dvg_gran_colombia.2.d: "As we feared, the appetite of the Spanish beast for blood and slaughter knows no limits. Spain has ended the armistice by formally announcing their intent to resume their efforts to destroy us. As our brave and noble soldiers march forth into battle, they do not go alone."
 dvg_gran_colombia.2.f: "They go with the spirits and the hearts of every man, woman, and child in the Colombian Alliance, with the love and the trust of every precious life which they are sworn to lay down their own to defend. Northern Arcadia and southern Ameriga have achieved freedom from their colonial masters – we can do no less."
 dvg_gran_colombia.2.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] shall prevail!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.3.t: "Success in the Independence War"
 dvg_gran_colombia.3.d: "Throughout its existence, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] Alliance has been in a twilight zone of half-nationhood. A massive conglomeration of regions, cultures, and languages, many feared that the Alliance would disintegrate as soon as the war with Spain was won."
 dvg_gran_colombia.3.f: "It seems, however, that these fears were misplaced, or at least exaggerated. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has persevered as a unified entity, albeit as a highly decentralized confederation. The goal now is to untangle the government and find a stable, durable form of administration."
 dvg_gran_colombia.3.a: "At last, the true work begins."
 dvg_gran_colombia.4.t: "The Restoration of New Spain"
 dvg_gran_colombia.4.d: "The total defeat of the Colombian Alliance has allowed Spain to recreate the old Viceroyalty of New Spain. The lands of southern Arcadia once more fly the Lorena-Aviz banner, and the Catholic priests in churches throughout the colony once more give praise to the King of Spain, the Most Holy Monarch."
 dvg_gran_colombia.4.f: "Yet the ideals of Colombia – independence, democracy, and personal liberty – can never truly be extinguished. The return of New Spain to the imperial fold may yet force its mother country to learn the ways of her daughter and respect her. For if she does not…"
 dvg_gran_colombia.4.a: "All we can do is tend our gardens beneath the Spanish flag."
 # dvg_gran_colombia.5.t: "The Spanish Want a Truce"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.5.d: "The Spanish decide to withdraw from Colombia..."
 # dvg_gran_colombia.5.f: "With the war being waged for so long, the Spanish have decided to abandon the former Viceroyalty of New Spain. Gran Colombia shall now be free to decide its fate on the world stage."
 # dvg_gran_colombia.5.a: "A victory nonetheless."
 dvg_gran_colombia.6.t: "Herrerian Revolution"
 dvg_gran_colombia.6.d: "Guillermo de Blanco has finally emerged from hiding and led his guerillas into Bogota, capping off a period of raiding and recruitment that has seen his band of followers swell into a true revolutionary army. He has now declared the Republic of Herreria, named after the “Father of the Revolution,” José de Herrera, and is engaged in a fight for the fate of New Granada against the Spanish."
 dvg_gran_colombia.6.f: "As we share his animosity towards Spain, de Blanco has petitioned us to aid him, and to join forces against the Spanish Crown. If he is successful, then perhaps we could leverage this into Herreria joining the Colombian Alliance, finally securing the massive, revolutionary New World state of de Herrera’s dreams. Of course, more pessimistic, cynical ministers see de Blanco as a power-mad brute, infamous for his hatred of the Incas and more likely to be a liability than an ally. Still, surely a free Herreria is preferable to a hostile New Granada?"
 dvg_gran_colombia.6.a: "Herreria calls, and Colombia will answer!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.6.b: "Let de Blanco fight his own battles."
 dvg_gran_colombia.7.t: "Fall of Colombia"
 dvg_gran_colombia.7.d: "”When this country was emancipated, it sought equality, justice, and reason. Yet the representatives that were elected did not represent the people, and the leaders that were chosen have not led us to success. The aim of this proclamation is to make clear the necessity of restoring honor to the nation…” – General Agustín de Santander"
 dvg_gran_colombia.7.f: "The failure of the Colombian government to support the Herrerian Revolution and the collapse of the radical cause in New Granada has spurred dissent against the Vicente regime. A conservative general named Agustín de Santander took advantage of Vicente being confined to his bed with a fever, and led a military contingent into Mexico City, declaring himself the new President of Colombia. With the opposition paralyzed, it seems that Santander’s reign has already begun."
 dvg_gran_colombia.7.a: "Viva o Presidente!"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.8.t: "The Colombian Navy"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.8.d: "Grand Opening of the Colombian Navy"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.8.f: "Wonderful news, my caudillo! We have recently finished with our project to build up a proper Colombian navy. During the Colombian War of Independence, we couldn't reach Cuba due to lack of navy against the Spanish Armada despite the Cuban's contribution to the revolution. With our newly created navy, hopefully we can reunite with our Cuban compatriots against Spanish imperialism once again."
 # dvg_gran_colombia.8.a: "One step closer to Cuba!"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.9.t: "Cuban Affair"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.9.d: "The Conquest of Cuba"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.9.f: "Great news! We have recently liberated Cuba from the Spanish once and for all. During the Colombian War of Independence, we couldn't reach Cuba due to lack of navy against the Spanish Armada despite the Cuban's contribution to the revolution. Since the Spanish are distracted by nationalist problems at home, we managed to liberate Cuba from their grasp, ending centuries of Spanish rule on the island."
 # dvg_gran_colombia.9.a: "At last, the remnant of Spanish colonialism has returned to Colombia!"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.10.t: "Granadan Affair"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.10.d: "The Conquest of Granada"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.10.f: "More news, my caudillo! After months of campaigning, we have recently conquered Granada. During the Colombian War of Independence, Granada was once a Spanish loyalist stronghold, but with the Spanish withdrawal, Granada remains no match to our might once we marched down to Medellín. Despite our liberation, we are currently facing resistance in Granada and we must quell it down before we could advance to our next target."
 # dvg_gran_colombia.10.a: "Granada is ours!"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.11.t: "The Pacification of Granada"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.11.d: "Pacifying Granada"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.11.f: "Despite the difficulties that we faced so far, we have recently pacified Granada for good. The Granadan resistance has cited nationalist reasons such as cultural and language differences between the Colombian and the Granadan, and that they wish to remain independent from Colombia. Luckily, our persuasion campaign to the Granadan populace has paid off with many Granadans agreed to join our cause for a greater Colombia."
 # dvg_gran_colombia.11.a: "Colombia grows larger everyday!"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.12.t: "New Toledan Affair"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.12.d: "The Conquest of New Toledo"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.12.f: "Even more wonderful news! We have recently finished our liberation of New Toledo. Despite the New Toledans' contribution to our liberation of Granada from Spanish rule, they have remained hesitant with joining Colombia. Since our liberation, we have began sending officials to convince the New Toledans on supporting to unification of Colombia and New Toledo."
 # dvg_gran_colombia.12.a: "At last, the total reunification from Colombia to New Toledo!"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.13.t: "Foreign Policy"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.13.d: "Military Policy"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.13.f: "Since Spain no longer controls continental Ameriga and Arcardia, let us focus on our military relation with Granada and New Toledo. One option is a full military alliance between the three nations. Another option is to form a defensive pact between the three nations. The last option would be to keep relation at arm's length to avoid any complications when either Granada or New Toledo is at war."
 # dvg_gran_colombia.13.a: "Let us cement the Colombian alliance!"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.13.b: "Let us keep it as a defensive pact."
 # dvg_gran_colombia.13.c: "It is best to keep the relation at arm's length."
 # dvg_gran_colombia.14.t: "Foreign Policy"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.14.d: "Trade Policy"
 # dvg_gran_colombia.14.f: "Since we are done with the military policy, let us focus on trade policy. Considering that all three nations are underdeveloped currently, one proposal would be to establish a custom union so all three nations can have access to each other's market. Another option is to establish trade agreements between the three nations to allow reduced tariffs for trade goods while ensuring that the three nations' markets remain independent. The third option is to do neither as the Colombian market would not benefit from either deals."
 # dvg_gran_colombia.14.a: "A trade agreement would suffice."
 # dvg_gran_colombia.14.b: "On second thought, maybe this is not necessary."
 dvg_gran_colombia.15.t: "The Fate of Vicente"
 dvg_gran_colombia.15.d: "President Anastasio Vicente has been under an unusual amount of stress lately. Rural landowners and provincial caudillos are beginning to express opposition to any reform of the current, massively decentralized system, alarmed by Vicente’s federalist proposals. The president has received some rather irate and threatening letters over his plans, but these crude attempts at intimidation have not dissuaded him. He knows that federalism is necessary for Colombia to be more than just a republican New Spain."
 dvg_gran_colombia.15.f: "Colombia will never develop a national identity unless it is one nation, and it will never be one nation if it leans too far either towards ruthless centralization or slothful decentralization. As Vicente continues his work, this time on a letter to the Caudillo of Andagoya about tariffs, he hears a noise at the door. Strange, he thinks to himself - everyone else in the presidential palace ought to be asleep by now. Heading to the door, he opens it to find…"
 dvg_gran_colombia.15.a: "His faithful black cat, Santa Anna"
 dvg_gran_colombia.15.b: "An assassin, who guns him down and flees out the window!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.16.t: "The Death of Vicente"
 dvg_gran_colombia.16.d: "Rumors of the President’s assassination spread through Mexico City like a wildfire, but only this morning was it confirmed, in a somber announcement by Vice President Benito Villa. The murder of the Father of the Nation has caused Mexico City to descend into chaos. As Vicente had not yet formalized the method of presidential succession, the uncharismatic Villa has been all but forgotten as multiple politicians and officers have declared themselves acting president of Colombia. Street brawls have erupted into shootouts, as neighborhoods become battlegrounds."
 dvg_gran_colombia.16.f: "Two sides have emerged: the centralists, who see Vicente’s death as proof that a strong hand is needed to rule Colombia, and the radical federalists, who are prepared to take decentralization to its limits if it means preventing more violence in the future. As the blood flows through the streets of the cradle of south Arcadian liberty, it is unclear whether this is Colombia’s crucible or its requiem."
 dvg_gran_colombia.16.a: "God help us all!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.17.t: "The Plan of Toluca"
 dvg_gran_colombia.17.d: "Amidst the carnage of Mexico City following President Vicente’s death, Lusitanian General Deodoro Peixoto managed to secure control of the Mexico City countryside. Backed by the rural landowners, Peixoto and his supporters gathered in Toluca and proclaimed the Plan of Toluca. In it, Peixoto has declared the Colombian experiment to be a failure! Citing the “irreconcilable” differences between its various regions and cultures, Peixoto seeks to allow Colombia’s constituent parts to go their own way."
 dvg_gran_colombia.17.f: "With overwhelming support from various caudillos, he fought his way back into the capital and quelled the unrest, being sworn in as President shortly thereafter. Soon, the Colombian legislature shall hold a vote to abolish the Alliance, and then Colombia’s major provincial caudillos will meet in Oaxaca City in two weeks to officially dissolve it."
 dvg_gran_colombia.17.a: "Perhaps we were not meant to be one nation."
 dvg_gran_colombia.18.t: "The Oaxaca Protocol"
 dvg_gran_colombia.18.d: "Tensions in Colombia exploded in the aftermath of President Vicente’s assassination. No figure has yet emerged who could unify the confederation with the charisma and diplomacy of Vicente, or who commands as much respect as he did. Bowing to what radical federalists see as the inevitable, the Colombian legislature passed a bill voting the nation out of existence, and now the caudillos of Colombia’s various provinces have convened in Oaxaca City to dissolve the confederation."
 dvg_gran_colombia.18.f: "President Peixoto opened the event with a short but poignant speech reiterating the need for dissolution, arguing that Colombia as a single nation-state will inevitably become repressive and that each nationality must obtain liberty. However, there are whispers that Lieutenant Colonel Ernesto Castro, popular centralist icon, escaped the Mexico City anarchy and has been preparing to stage a coup in a desperate bid to avert the confederation’s dissolution. What shall be the fate of Colombia?"
 dvg_gran_colombia.18.a: "Peixoto secures Colombia’s end – and Lusitania for himself."
 dvg_gran_colombia.18.b: "Castro invades the city, arrests the radicals, and seizes Colombia!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.19.t: "The Plan of Veracruz"
 dvg_gran_colombia.19.d: "Amidst the carnage of Mexico City following President Vicente’s death, Lieutenant Colonel Castro took control of the vital port city of Veracruz while order in the rest of the country began to collapse. A dashing young Cuban, he proved a skilled tactician during the First Colombian War of Independence, repeatedly outfoxing the Spanish with clever and innovative maneuvers, and rose meteorically through the ranks. He achieved true fame when he liberated Veracruz and then fended off three separate Spanish attempts to reconquer it."
 dvg_gran_colombia.19.f: "Now, in the city which won him his fame, Castro has rallied the military and the centralists to his side with the Plan of Veracruz, announcing his intention to establish a strong central government and curtail radicalism. Even some rural elites have supported him, possibly believing that he will prove a pawn if successful. With most of the military now loyal to him, he has fallen like a thunderbolt upon Mexico City, and soon enough he shall be sworn in as the new President."
 dvg_gran_colombia.19.a: "Viva el Presidente!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.20.t: "Castro’s Inaugural Speech"
 dvg_gran_colombia.20.d: "After Castro was sworn into office, he gave a speech to the assembled crowd, outlining his goals and intentions going forward. “Colombia is destined to be a colossus of the New World,” he declared, “but only if we give her the sword and the shield which she needs.” Castro went on to explain that this meant a strong, centralized government, an orderly political sphere, and a bold foreign policy “unafraid to make adventurous choices in the interest of liberation.” He confidently predicted that Colombia will be “the true seat of power in the New World.”"
 dvg_gran_colombia.20.f: "Castro wound up his remarks by stating that he was “prepared to bring a new, visionary strength to the Colombian executive, the likes of which few have seen before, or even dreamt of.” Centralists and expansionists were thrilled by his rhetoric, but many others - especially rural elites - were concerned by his implications. #red If Castro does not make Colombia a world power, then there may be consequences.#"
 dvg_gran_colombia.20.a: "May he steward Colombia well!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.21.t: "The Cuban Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.21.d: "As Castro continues to reshape domestic politics, he has taken an interest in foreign affairs as well. Specifically, he has set his sights upon Cuba, and has initiated a media campaign to promote the Colombian government’s claim to the island. Castro has stressed Cuba’s “ethnic and political kinship” with Colombia, its “indisputable destiny” to “be united” with Colombia, and the “urgent necessity” of “admitting” Cuba into “our grand nation.”"
 dvg_gran_colombia.21.f: "The Cuban authorities have taken this news poorly, and Castro’s bellicose remarks have been criticized both by Cuban conservatives, who are largely sympathetic to the Spanish crown and fearful of Colombian radicalism, and Cuban liberals, many of whom demand a free and sovereign Cuba. Nevertheless, Castro has committed vast political resources to acquiring Cuba. #red If Castro cannot fulfill his assertions, then there may be consequences.#"
 dvg_gran_colombia.21.a: "Cuba was, is, and will be Colombian!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.22.t: "The Plan of Colima"
 dvg_gran_colombia.22.d: "”I forgive everyone, and I ask everyone to forgive me. May my blood, which is about to be shed, be for the good of the country. Long live Colombia, long live independence!” – Last words of Ernesto Castro"
 dvg_gran_colombia.22.f: "In the chaos following Vicente’s death, Colombians saw Ernesto Castro as the man who could raise Colombia to greatness, but Castro has failed to fulfill his lofty promises. The caudillos have been disillusioned by his callous centralization, and they have sought another savior. They found General Agustín de Santander, an ambitious and charismatic officer of noble blood and with many elite connections. Santander issued the Plan of Colima, promising to end centralization and respect Colombia’s regional differences, and rallied public support against Castro. Quickly marching on Mexico City, Castro was deposed after a brief battle, before being tried, convicted, and executed for treason. Once more, the presidency of Colombia has been claimed through bloodshed."
 dvg_gran_colombia.22.a: "Viva el presidente! Viva Santander!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.23.t: "The Plan of Colima"
 dvg_gran_colombia.23.d: "Castro’s overthrow by a liberal revolution was supposed to usher in a new era of enlightened, scientific governance. Yet this concept terrified caudillos across the nation, who stood to lose much from the liberal disdain for traditional networks of power. To preserve their influence, they have rallied behind General Agustín de Santander, a man of noble blood and charismatic personality."
 dvg_gran_colombia.23.f: "Santander recently issued the “Plan of Colima,” denouncing the liberals as heartless thieves, promising to respect Colombia’s regional differences, and exhorting the Colombian people to stand up for their traditions and institutions. Flush with caudillo money, Santander then swooped down on Mexico City with an army of followers, casting out the liberals and claiming the Colombian presidency for himself. With Castro’s wife taking his infant son into exile in the Dual Monarchy, both liberalism and Castroism lie defeated, and the age of Santander has begun."
 dvg_gran_colombia.23.a: "Viva el presidente! Viva Santander!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.24.t: "Rise of Emperor Castro"
 dvg_gran_colombia.24.d: "The Self Coup and Aftermath"
 dvg_gran_colombia.24.f: "To the surprise of many, Castro decided to have himself crowned as Emperor and his wife as Empress of the Colombian Empire. Many liberals criticize the move as Castro becoming not so different than the old monarch that they overthrew, but with Castro having the government under his thumb, it would be difficult to criticize him openly."
 dvg_gran_colombia.24.a: "Long live the Emperor!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.25.t: "Death of Emperor Castro"
 dvg_gran_colombia.25.d: "Emperor Ernesto created a strong, centralized government, a powerful nation free from caudillismo : for him to take up a crown in the aftermath was only natural. Some, however, disagreed, despising Ernesto for violating their notions of Colombian republicanism. Now these traitors have committed the vilest crime. As the Emperor was heading through downtown Mexico City on his return from a diplomatic visit to the Dual Monarchy, an assassin leapt from the crowd and fired upon him! Both he and his wife, Empress Eva, were pronounced dead at the hospital."
 dvg_gran_colombia.25.f: "The assassin, quickly apprehended by the gendarmes, was identified as Emilio Cardenas, an anarchist with ties to republican groups. The regicide has horrified Colombians yet has not ignited revolts. While many republicans are now trying to press for radical political change, it seems that the rule of the House de Castro has been accepted, the popularity of the new Emperor Ernesto II – and the regency which shall rule until he is no longer a child - sealed by the martyrdom of his father."
 dvg_gran_colombia.25.a: "The end of an era, or merely the start of one?"
 dvg_gran_colombia.26.t: "The Golden Constitution"
 dvg_gran_colombia.26.d: "The assassination of Emperor Ernesto may not have incited a civil war, but the political situation is nevertheless perilous. Many republicans resigned themselves to quieter means of political struggle while Ernesto the First was alive, but news of his death threatened to give his enemies the chance to tear down the institutions which he built. The landlords and caudillos certainly had no special attraction to the man they saw as the reason for their decline."
 dvg_gran_colombia.26.f: "Thus, to prevent the republicans from deposing the regency, the monarchists have been forced to make massive concessions to their political rivals for the sake of national unity. The “Golden Constitution,” as liberals have called it, extends tremendous political rights, including universal suffrage and a free press, while also federalizing the government. Ernesto the First would be turning in his grave if he knew what the regency council has done but at least the empire which he built will survive him."
 dvg_gran_colombia.26.a: "Respect for the rights of others means peace."
 dvg_gran_colombia.27.t: "The Constitution Convention of [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.GetString]"
 dvg_gran_colombia.27.d: "President Vicente has announced his boldest plan yet: the creation of a Colombian constitution to transform the nation into a united, democratic, parliamentary republic. The document lays out protections for the rights of the people, and clarifies the roles, powers, and responsibilities of the national government."
 dvg_gran_colombia.27.f: "While Vicente has taken care to delineate the boundaries of federal authority and reserve numerous rights and duties to the provinces, the document has already drawn strong criticism from provincial caudillos as a dictum handed down from above rather than the result of popular debate. The president is counting on his status as a national hero, and the courting of liberal sentiments, to ensure the constitution’s ratification, and drafts are already being delivered to the Colombian state governments."
 dvg_gran_colombia.27.a: "Is democracy within reach?"
 dvg_gran_colombia.28.t: "The Morelia Manifesto"
 dvg_gran_colombia.28.d: "The new constitution has been met with concern and suspicion by many Colombian caudillos. Many of them have now gathered in Morelia, where they have drafted a document to explain their objections to Vicente and his supporters. The manifesto claims that the constitution as written concentrates an unacceptable amount of power into the hands of the federal government, opening the door for any of Vicente’s successors to use it to strangle the provinces. Moreover, they have criticized the process of the constitution’s promulgation, objecting to having been left out of the creative process."
 dvg_gran_colombia.28.f: "The document closes with their rejection of the new constitution. Our cabinet has plans for a conference in which to iron out a new draft, but we require a political victory on another front to convince them to negotiate. One idea is to solve the California Question, the problem of Hispanic Catholics under Qingqiu's control. If we can make progress there - through peace or war - then we could use that momentum to call a constitutional conference."
 dvg_gran_colombia.28.a: "Whatever it takes to bring democracy to Colombia..."
 dvg_gran_colombia.29.t: "Vicente Calls the Veracruz Conference"
 dvg_gran_colombia.29.d: "The answering of the California Question has given Vicente the political momentum to rescue his constitution. The caudillos thought to thwart it with a denouncement from Morelia, but Vicente is not so easily dissuaded. Nor shall he resort to open violence to force them into compliance. The Father of the Nation has not gotten this far in life without a calculating patience. Recognizing that these men have merely objected to the constitution’s form, not its existence, he has summoned all the major caudillos of Colombia to a conference in Veracruz."
 dvg_gran_colombia.29.f: "There, Vicente, his supporters, and the caudillos shall together devise a new draft constitution. By involving the caudillos in the writing process, nobody will be able to say that they were left out - and with Vicente's foreign policy success, no caudillo dares turn down an invitation from Colombia's acclaimed leader. Hopes are high that the conference will bring reconciliation and avoid a crisis, but only time will tell if Vicente’s idealism will survive the caudillos’ objections."
 dvg_gran_colombia.29.a: "To Veracruz!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.30.t: "The Veracruz Conference"
 dvg_gran_colombia.30.d: "Presidente Vicente and all the state caudillos of Colombia have arrived in the city of Veracruz to revise the constitution into a form acceptable by all parties. At stake is not simply the future of Colombia’s government, but the very ideas of representative democracy and liberal republicanism."
 dvg_gran_colombia.30.f: "Vicente is serious about defending his ideas, but he knows that even he, the “Father of the Nation,” is not invincible. If Vicente and his liberal supporters reject too many of the conservatives’ proposals, then the consequences for both the constitution and the republic may be dire."
 dvg_gran_colombia.30.a: "Let’s get to work."
 dvg_gran_colombia.31.t: "Education Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.31.d: "The first contentious topic of the Veracruz Conference is education and its funding. Even before our independence, Colombia has an imbalance when it comes to literacy and education as the majority of the population are illiterate."
 dvg_gran_colombia.31.f: "The liberals propose a large funding of state school in order to improve literacy and education across Colombia. The moderates propose for some education reform such as building more schools, but prefers to keep funding minimal as it would be a drain on the economy. The conservatives prefer to keep education reform as it is as there are more pressing concerns such as the military. The conference eventually settles on…"
 dvg_gran_colombia.31.a: "The liberal option of large funding for state school."
 dvg_gran_colombia.31.b: "The moderate option of minimal funding for state school."
 dvg_gran_colombia.31.c: "The conservative option of no education reform."
 dvg_gran_colombia.32.t: "Slavery Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.32.d: "The next contentious matter is that of Colombian slavery. Ever since Colombia was a Spanish colony, it was common for the gentry keeps slaves in their estates."
 dvg_gran_colombia.32.f: "With the independence of Colombia, however, liberals have argued that slavery is anathema to the idea of Colombia as a republic and propose for total abolition of slavery across Colombia. Many conservatives, however, feel that such topics are inappropriate for this conference, and the caudillos are intensely wary of language setting down immigration as something which only the federal government, not individual state governments, can control. Moderates have suggested a transitional period where slave states should retain their status, but slavery shall not expand any further if Colombia expands further. The conference eventually settles on…"
 dvg_gran_colombia.32.a: "The liberal option of total abolition of slavery."
 dvg_gran_colombia.32.b: "The moderate option of transition to abolition."
 dvg_gran_colombia.32.c: "The conservative option of keeping slavery."
 dvg_gran_colombia.33.t: "Immigration Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.33.d: "The next contentious matter is that of Colombian immigration. Ever since the Alliance coalesced, the government has essentially avoided the topic, preferring to focus on consolidation and defending against Spain."
 dvg_gran_colombia.33.f: "With Colombia’s future as a nation seemingly confirmed, however, liberals have argued that a national, official “open door” policy should be adopted to draw new immigrants to enrich the nation. Many conservatives, however, feel that such topics are inappropriate for this conference, and the caudillos are intensely wary of language setting down immigration as something which only the federal government, not individual state governments, can control. Moderates have suggested inserting immigration-friendly language into the constitutional preamble, the part most likely to be read by foreigners, but without any new immigration laws. The conference eventually settles on…"
 dvg_gran_colombia.33.a: "The liberal option of an official open door policy."
 dvg_gran_colombia.33.b: "The moderate option of pro-immigration imagery."
 dvg_gran_colombia.33.c: "The conservative option of minimal aid for native integration."
 dvg_gran_colombia.34.t: "Native Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.34.d: "Tremendous arguments have emerged around the issue of the native populations within Colombia."
 dvg_gran_colombia.34.f: "Liberals seek paths for natives to obtain full citizenship, so long as they meet certain qualifications of literacy and personal morality, and the creation of an Office of Native Affairs to assist in the assimilation of native peoples into Colombian society. Many caudillos, however, do not want native peoples to receive any special treatment beyond necessary measures to root out “antisocial behaviors and savage customs,” and furthermore believe that such matters are purely a state and local issue. Moderates have backed the creation of an Office of Native Affairs but suggest that it instead focus on establishing dedicated living areas for native peoples to inhabit in peace. The conference eventually settles on…"
 dvg_gran_colombia.34.a: "The liberal option of strong aid for native assimilation."
 dvg_gran_colombia.34.b: "The compromise option of moderate aid for native reservations."
 dvg_gran_colombia.34.c: "The conservative option of minimal aid for native integration."
 dvg_gran_colombia.35.t: "Military Service Policy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.35.d: "Debate has finally reached the topic which Vicente has been dreading : the composition of the Colombian military. Ever since the end of the conflict with Spain, Vicente has believed that only a robust system of mandatory military training and service, drawing upon all levels of society, could provide Colombia with the defense it needs."
 dvg_gran_colombia.35.f: "Such a concept strikes at the very heart of aristocratic and stratocratic privilege which supports many provincial caudillos and is anathema to the traditionalist officer corps of the Colombian military. Moderates have proposed a minimal program of basic training for all adult Colombian males, but even this may be too much for the conservatives to stomach. At the heart of this debate is a question: do the states control their militaries, loaning them to the federal government when needed? Or does the federal government control the military, calling upon anyone who can fight and making rich and poor man alike an equally capable soldier? The conference eventually settles on…"
 dvg_gran_colombia.35.a: "The liberal option of mandatory service."
 dvg_gran_colombia.35.b: "The moderate option of basic training."
 dvg_gran_colombia.35.c: "The conservative option of the traditional military organization."
 dvg_gran_colombia.36.t: "Ratification of the Colombian Constitution"
 dvg_gran_colombia.36.d: "After tense and extensive debate between liberals and conservatives, President Vicente and the provincial caudillos have finally arrived at a compromise and drafted a new Colombian constitution."
 dvg_gran_colombia.36.f: "Though highly conservative in some respects, the final document upholds Vicente’s principles of democratic, representative federalism. Furthermore, the conference has established a positive precedent for the peaceful resolution of Colombia’s political disputes via debate and collaboration, not intrigue and warfare. All eyes are now on Vicente, to see if he will be able to prove the constitution’s worth by elevating Colombia to new heights of greatness. If he cannot do so even with the document which he and his supporters worked so hard to achieve, then the luster may fade from his achievement and the wolves may once again lurk at the door."
 dvg_gran_colombia.36.a: "We shall not disappoint the people."
 dvg_gran_colombia.37.t: "The Treason of Santander"
 dvg_gran_colombia.37.d: "The Veracruz Conference, rather than find a compromise between President Vicente and his critics, instead saw the liberals attempt to force upon the conservatives a document which they had no interest in supporting."
 dvg_gran_colombia.37.f: "When news of this leaked out, General Agustín de Santander, a man known for his aristocratic background and his strong ties to various Colombian landlords, declared the conference illegal and attempted to arrest Vicente and his liberal supporters! While many reformists were seized by Santander’s rebels, a few managed to smuggle Vicente out of Veracruz and back to Mexico City. As the constitutional draft languishes forgotten, the future of Colombia hangs in the balance."
 dvg_gran_colombia.37.a: "A disaster!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.38.t: "A Midnight Meeting"
 dvg_gran_colombia.38.d: "Santander soon realized that he’d been tricked : with no sign of Vicente within Veracruz, he raced to Mexico City and will soon be at its gates. In the middle of the night, with Santander and his forces expected to arrive the next morning, Vicente is called upon by two mysterious men. After his guards search them and Vicente receives them in his office, they reveal themselves: Deodoro Peixoto and Puente de Marquez, the two most powerful caudillos in Colombia."
 dvg_gran_colombia.38.f: "They explain that they have come as representatives of Colombia’s caudillos, who do not trust Santander and fear that he may become a tyrant in ways which Vicente has never been. Therefore, they are willing to throw their forces to Vicente’s defense and shatter Santander’s coup attempt, but their price is steep. Peixoto and de Marquez demand nothing less than total autonomy for their states in return for their aid, and warn that if Vicente refuses, they will swallow their pride and back Santander to prevent liberal domination. What happened next is well recorded…"
 dvg_gran_colombia.38.a: "Vicente agreed, and Santander was defeated and executed for treason."
 dvg_gran_colombia.38.b: "Vicente refused, and was deposed and exiled days later."
 dvg_gran_colombia.39.t: "The Plan of Veracruz"
 dvg_gran_colombia.39.d: "With Santander defeated by the caudillos, Vicente has had to hold up his end of the bargain. He has returned to Veracruz, this time not to build a new Colombia, but perhaps to set the stage for its fall. By the terms of the newly published Plan of Veracruz, vast swathes of Colombia have become virtually sovereign except in matters of foreign affairs and defense."
 dvg_gran_colombia.39.f: "Although the new Colombian constitution has been promulgated within Colombia proper, it will not be applicable within the territories of Lusitania or San Salvador. Many liberals are horrified with what they see as a critical weakening of Colombia. Vicente has defended Colombian democracy, but only time will tell if it was worth the cost. #red If Lusitania or San Salvador become entirely independent from Colombia then even Vicente may not be able to prevent total dissolution.#"
 dvg_gran_colombia.39.a: "The Colombian dream hangs by a thread."
 dvg_gran_colombia.40.t: "Our New Autonomy"
 dvg_gran_colombia.40.d: "Our nation is now an autonomous component of Colombia, sovereign internally but dependent externally."
 dvg_gran_colombia.40.f: "How long this shall last – and whether it will lead to our independence – remains to be seen."
 dvg_gran_colombia.40.a: "Liberty?"
 dvg_gran_colombia.41.t: "The End of Colombia"
 dvg_gran_colombia.41.d: "The Colombian dream is over. This morning, President Anastasio Vicente was found deceased in his bed, having passed away in the night. News of the President’s death has caused the remaining caudillos to lose whatever shreds of loyalty they still possessed towards the federal government in Mexico City."
 dvg_gran_colombia.41.f: "Given that one of the ‘autonomous territories’ had already become independent, this came as little surprise, yet it confirmed what many had known for some time already: Colombia has followed its father to the grave. Vice President Benito Villa was sworn in shortly after Vicente’s death was discovered, and his first act as president was to request that the legislature formally dissolve Colombia and institute a new nation in its place - the Mexican Republic. With both Lusitania and San Salvador now beyond our reach, we can only hope that our new nation will know greater peace than the one which we have left behind."
 dvg_gran_colombia.41.a: "The problem with dreams is that you always wake up from them."
 dvg_gran_colombia.42.t: "The Rise of Santander"
 dvg_gran_colombia.42.d: "”Do the people of Colombia and those who administrate its provinces have the freedom to act, or do they not? From Vicente, we have been told that we have only the freedom to obey. Is this the greatness which we were promised? We who had the resolution to attack Spanish tyranny also have the resolution to fight Mexico City autocracy. If our leaders cannot lead us to success then we have no reason to follow them.” – General Agustín de Santander"
 dvg_gran_colombia.42.f: "Not everybody has been satisfied with the new constitution, and Colombian reactionaries have found a standard bearer in General Agustín de Santander, a man of aristocratic origins and good friend of the landholding elite. Santander has given several acidic speeches denouncing Vicente as a despot and a man long past his prime. Some dismiss such charges as ludicrous, but his appeal may grow if Vicente cannot achieve sufficiently grand success for Colombia."
 dvg_gran_colombia.42.a: "Colombia shall brook no Caesars."
 dvg_gran_colombia.43.t: "The Plan of Tepic"
 dvg_gran_colombia.43.d: "Santander has finally reached the apogee of his vanity. With the support of local elites from his home province of Jalisco, he has drafted a proclamation denouncing Vicente as a tyrant and declaring that only “fair and tolerant” governance, “free of excessive interference,” can bring order and progress to Colombia."
 dvg_gran_colombia.43.f: "The Plan concludes by vesting authority in Santander to launch a military coup against Vicente. This would be cause for alarm…yet reports indicate that Santander is far less popular than many believe. If Vicente holds firm and quickly issues a response calling on the people to support him against Santander’s scheme, it might foil the whole plot. Of course, Vicente is not a young man, and there is a small but undeniable temptation in retirement..."
 dvg_gran_colombia.43.a: "Perhaps it is time for a changing of the guard."
 dvg_gran_colombia.43.b: "Let Colombia answer its father’s call one final time!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.44.t: "The Plan of Tepic"
 dvg_gran_colombia.44.d: "Santander has finally reached the apogee of his vanity. With the support of local elites from his home province of Jalisco, he has drafted a proclamation denouncing Vicente as a tyrant and declaring that only “fair and tolerant” governance, “free of excessive interference,” can bring order and progress to Colombia."
 dvg_gran_colombia.44.f: "The Plan concludes by vesting authority in Santander to launch a military coup against Vicente. With much of the Colombian military thoroughly dissatisfied with Vicente, Santander has rallied them to depose the president and inaugurate himself in Vicente’s place. As the Father of the Nation flees into exile, likely never to return, a new order dawns over Colombia, lit by the fire smouldering in Santander’s eyes."
 dvg_gran_colombia.44.a: "Viva Santander! Viva el Presidente!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.45.t: "The Reform War"
 dvg_gran_colombia.45.d: "Santander must surely have been disappointed when he realized that the rest of the nation was not going to rally to his traitorous call. However, the General still commands considerable support within his home state of Jalisco, and he has leveraged this into an insurrection."
 dvg_gran_colombia.45.f: "Rallying what limited forces he can muster, Santander has declared his intent to march on Mexico City and depose Vicente! Very few people outside of Jalisco have any expectation that he will prevail, but General Santander is determined to make one final bid for supreme power. As the Jaliscans raise the banner of rebellion, it seems that Vicente’s fight for democracy must once more be fought on the fields of battle."
 dvg_gran_colombia.45.a: "Death to traitors! Viva Colombia!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.46.t: "The End of an Era"
 dvg_gran_colombia.46.d: "The defeat and execution of the traitorous General Agustín de Santander has finally given Vicente and the liberals a chance to clean out the reactionary rot that has infested Colombia for far too long. Across the nation, government officials known to be corrupt or arch-reactionaries have been forced to resign, and the elections which have been called to replace them herald the coming of a new generation."
 dvg_gran_colombia.46.f: " It is a generation which shall take at face value Vicente’s principles of democracy and republicanism. Vicente has seen to it that they shall inherit a better nation by promulgating yet another constitutional revision, this time one of true liberal reform, to do what he could not at Veracruz. The legislature has already signed it, and the convention which shall be called to ratify it a mere formality. For the first time since the end of the war with Spain, when Vicente feels the aching in his bones which remind him of his age, he is not troubled, for he knows that he has laid a strong foundation for future Colombians to build upon."
 dvg_gran_colombia.46.a: "Liberty is made difficult because it is the accomplishment and perfectness of man."
 dvg_gran_colombia.47.t: "Herencia"
 dvg_gran_colombia.47.d: "Last night, President Anastasio Vicente decided to retire to bed early to prepare for campaigning to support a liberal candidate, Porfirio Juarez, in the state of Yucatan. When, next morning, the president had not arisen over an hour after usual, a servant discovered that Vicente had passed away in his sleep the previous night."
 dvg_gran_colombia.47.f: "Word soon spread of this, and now all of Colombia is in mourning over the man who had more than earned his title of Father of the Nation. Thousands upon thousands have traveled to Mexico City, from the wealthiest caudillos to threadbare peasants, to pay their respects to the man who sacrificed every ounce of his strength towards liberty and democracy. Vicente leaves behind not only a family of kin, but the family of Colombia, the sons and daughters who have grown up in the same national household and who now must navigate the world without their father. Their inheritance – a strong democracy, an equitable federal government, and a just constitution – is a gift which few others can claim."
 dvg_gran_colombia.47.a: "“Amor regge suo imperio senza spada.”"
 dvg_gran_colombia.48.t: "The Santanderana"
 dvg_gran_colombia.48.d: "When Santander was building up his power base, many people thought that they understood him. They saw him as a friend of the elites, and an enemy of liberalism and centralism, somebody who would create a weak federal government and allow the landlords, the church, and the military to carry on as they always had with minimal fuss."
 dvg_gran_colombia.48.f: "These people thought wrong. Santander certainly valued such institutions, but never as ends – only as means, the means to absolute power, which he now knows is within his grasp. And now that he is in control of Colombia, he intends to use that power to remake the entire nation in his image. He will tolerate those who wish to assist him, but all those who oppose him shall be destroyed. The northerners and the southerners will complain, he knows, but they will soon comprehend the glory of his vision or face the consequences. Colombia is now under a shadow, the shadow of the Santanderana."
 dvg_gran_colombia.48.a: "May God have mercy upon Colombia, for Santander shall have none."
 dvg_gran_colombia.49.t: "The Plot Against Colombia"
 dvg_gran_colombia.49.d: "Our illustrious President Agustín de Santander has keen powers of perception, far greater than most. This is how he became aware of a vast conspiracy, reaching from remote villages all the way to the halls of power, to destroy his revolution and plunge Colombia into the fires of ruin."
 dvg_gran_colombia.49.f: "Unfortunately, the national gendarmerie is not up to the task of rooting them out by themselves – and they may already be compromised. Therefore, Santander has published a pamphlet, titled “The Plot Against Colombia,” in which he outlines the conspiracy in broad terms and exhorts the citizens of Colombia to be vigilant and assist him in rooting out the traitors across the nation. Already, reports are coming in of hundreds, even thousands of suspicious individuals in Mexico City alone! Men and women denouncing Santander, praising traitors like Vicente, even discussing his overthrow! Lusitania and San Salvador seem to be especially rife with conspirators, and Santander has commanded his loyalists in these regions to be ready for action."
 dvg_gran_colombia.49.a: "If you aren’t with me, then you’re one of THEM!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.50.t: "The San Salvador City Massacre"
 dvg_gran_colombia.50.d: "The anti-conspiracy campaign of President Santander has borne fruit even sooner than he had hoped! It seems that a group of loyalists in San Salvador City became aware of rumors that the Salvadoran caudillo, Puente de Marquez, was in contact with Vicentistas abroad to engineer Santander’s overthrow, and that he had been overhead denouncing the president!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.50.f: "Outraged at a traitor in such a powerful position, these brave loyalists took it upon themselves to drive him out and deliver justice to him themselves. They attempted to storm the Salvadoran caudillo’s mansion, only halting when they came face to face with his personal guard. Rather than face justice, the cowardly de Marquez ordered his troops to open fire on the courageous patriots! Many virtuous men and women were cut down by the traitors’ legions, and Santander is more convinced than ever of the need to crack down upon these architects of intrigue."
 dvg_gran_colombia.50.a: "The martyrs gave their lives to destroy these criminals!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.51.t: "The Plan of Comayagua"
 dvg_gran_colombia.51.d: "President Santander’s suspicions have been confirmed: the caudillos have assumed leadership of the conspiracy! This morning the President received notice of a traitorous manifesto published by Lusitania’s Deodoro Peixoto and San Salvador’s Puente de Marquez."
 dvg_gran_colombia.51.f: "This “Plan of Comayagua” endorses such absurd concepts as “freedom against unlawful search and seizure,” and “accountability of the executive branch”! The document exhorts the President to call off the hunt for the conspiracy (Never!), arguing that it does not actually exist (Ridiculous!) and imploring Santander to restore the rule of law (I AM THE LAW!). Santander is unfazed – he knew that the heads of the hydra would rear one day. There is no need to negotiate with traitorous scum. The President has already dispatched gendarmes to arrest and execute the caudillos at once and has furthermore decided to eliminate all obstacles to maximum efficiency by revoking all governorships nationwide. Santander will personally appoint new governors to rule in his name and by his will."
 dvg_gran_colombia.51.a: "Finally, he thinks, sanity is coming to Colombia."
 dvg_gran_colombia.52.t: "Twilight of Colombia"
 dvg_gran_colombia.52.d: "MUTINY! Everywhere Santander looks, the pillars of the nation are collapsing before his very eyes! First, he received word that the gendarmes he sent to punish the caudillos instead swore loyalty to them! Then, both men announced the independence of their respective territories from Colombia!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.52.f: "Reports soon began to pour in from the northern and southern frontiers of soldiers native to Lusitania or San Salvador deserting their posts en masse and returning home, or even worse, swearing loyalty to Peixoto or de Marquez. As refugees begin to pour into Lusitania and San Salvador, and foreign investors flee in panic, chaos spreads across the land and it seems as though the conspiracy has succeeded. Santander grits his teeth as he surveys the damage, a map of his former nation sprawled across his desk. He already has a new plan – dangerous, difficult, but full of promise. Summoning the generals still loyal to him, he declares…"
 dvg_gran_colombia.52.a: "”Colombia shall endure, no matter the cost!”"
 dvg_gran_colombia.53.t: "Mexico’s Birthing Pains"
 dvg_gran_colombia.53.d: "Santander’s brilliant plan to dissolve Colombia and resurrect the insurrectionary state of Mexico has encountered a few small obstacles. First, the loss of Lusitania and San Salvador have sharply reduced the military and the civilian bureaucracy’s size and strength. Second, the breakdown in communications and general confusion have made it very difficult to relay orders outside of the vicinity of the capital. Third, many soldiers have either refused new orders or have departed the service entirely, becoming bandits or actively attempting to resist the new Mexican order."
 dvg_gran_colombia.53.f: "With both the army and the national gendarmerie in such a disorganized state, it is quite difficult to even administer Mexico, let alone bring order to it. In fact, many native communities, so long held in check by police surveillance and the threat of military incursion, have begun to organize militias to police their own communities. If these militias grow in size and strength then they could pose a severe challenge to our authority."
 dvg_gran_colombia.53.a: "Nothing that our glorious President cannot handle!
 dvg_gran_colombia.54.t: "The Natives are Revolting!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.54.d: "With the military and the national gendarmerie forced to focus on essential duties to keep the basic apparatus of government running, many native communities have been left to fend for themselves. Rather than devolving into squalid anarchy, as many officers expected, these communities have instead rapidly assembled militias to protect themselves."
 dvg_gran_colombia.54.f: "Recognizing the danger this posed, Santander wisely ordered said native militias forcibly dissolved. This proved easier said than done, as the pitiful state of the military meant that in many cases the native militias outnumbered the forces sent to arrest them, and said militias pursued the authorities as they withdrew. What started as raids on government outposts has now escalated into outright rebellion, as the Tarascans, the Zapotecs, and the Nahuas have all declared independent states!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.54.a: "Rebel scum!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.55.t: "The Plan of Guadalajara"
 dvg_gran_colombia.55.d: "It must be said that the current state of the country is less than ideal. Santander is convinced that a little patience and perseverance, and a lot of hard work, are all that is needed, but many cowardly liberals have lost faith!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.55.f: "Gathering in the city of Guadalajara – in Jalisco, the state of his birth, no less! – they have published the “Plan of Guadalajara,” a litany of traitorous denouncements. Accusing Santander of having “committed national patricide,” they have called for new elections, the deposing and trial of Santander for treason, the reversal of centralization, and many other unpatriotic ideas! Worst of all, many soldiers have defected to this newest phase of the anti-Santander conspiracy, and Mexico finds itself even further divided as the liberals declare an insurrection across Jalisco. The stage is set for the most important battle yet for Colombia’s inheritance…"

 dvg_gran_colombia.56.d: "Everywhere he goes, Santander is beset by misfortune, plagued by those who hate him, with only himself to rely upon. Everybody betrays Santander, in the end, if not now then later. The only person that he can ever have faith in is himself. Vicente, the Lusitanians, the Salvadorans, the Indians, now the Jaliscans, so many knives in his back."
 dvg_gran_colombia.56.f: "But Santander knows that this is the turning point against the conspiracy. This is the moment which will break them, the first step on the road to unimaginable power and success. The liberals babble that they will bring “salvation” to Mexico, but Santander knows that HE is the salvation of Mexico. Only Santander can save Mexico. Only Santander can resurrect Colombia. Only Santander can rule, and arbitrate, and govern, and bring peace. Only Santander. Only Santander. Only Santander."
 dvg_gran_colombia.56.a: "Remain calm. There is much to be done."
 dvg_gran_colombia.57.t: "Endurance of the Santanderana"
 dvg_gran_colombia.57.d: "Victory! The Jaliscan usurpers have been annihilated, and all the ringleaders sway from the Mexico City gallows. With the traitorous liberals destroyed, Santander can now turn his attention to those infernal Indians. They had the temerity not only to reject his benevolent rule, but to humiliate his proud forces while they stabbed him in the back and tried to mutilate Mexico! HIS Mexico!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.57.f: "The Lusitanians and Salvadorans did so as well, of course, but the blow from people as vile as the natives fell upon the President with even more bitterness. As Santander reviews his options to deal with the situation, he realizes that a simple military campaign will not be enough. No, as long as these troublesome identities persist within Santander’s realm, they will continue to be thorns in his side – the Indians and the Lusitanians are two sides of the same problem. Yes, there will need to be a reckoning, and after that, some more permanent solutions to the problems of separatism."
 dvg_gran_colombia.57.a: "So much work to be done, so little time."
 dvg_gran_colombia.58.t: "Liberalism Triumphant"
 dvg_gran_colombia.58.d: "Victory! The reformists have shattered the legions of the mad despot Santander and marched into Mexico City in glory. The dictator himself was found dead in his bedroom, having opened his veins with a knife like the Roman Emperor Nero before him. The hardcore Santandristas were put on trial for treason, and the less ideological minions which he installed across Mexico have been tactfully pressured to resign in exchange for being spared."
 dvg_gran_colombia.58.f: "Though the reign of the tyrant has been ended, much of Mexico lies in ruins, ravaged by war, neglect, and the chaos of the previous years. While Lusitania and San Salvador show no signs of wishing to return to our fold, the native states must be dealt with. The liberals do not wish to annihilate them, as Santander wished, but their very existence is a negation of Mexican sovereignty which cannot be tolerated. The work of rebuilding Mexico must be done both within and without."
 dvg_gran_colombia.58.a: "We shall make Vicente proud."
 dvg_gran_colombia.59.t: "The End of the Santanderana"
 dvg_gran_colombia.59.d: "Neither the liberals nor the Santandristas have been able to prevail over the other and seize control of Mexico. Once again, the matter has been settled by the military. The young General Manuel Diaz, a pious Catholic but also one with concealed liberal sympathies, emerged as the head of the highly secret anti-Santandrista movement within the Mexican army."
 dvg_gran_colombia.59.f: "Diaz, disgusted at Santander’s excesses and incompetence, has finally intervened, publishing the “Plan of Cuernavaca” to reveal Santander’s worst actions and call upon Mexican forces to stand down and cooperate with the Jaliscan liberals. Santander was slain in a brief gun battle when the Diazistas attempted to arrest him, and the gates of Mexico City have been opened to the liberals. Yet they arrive to find the Diazistas already preparing to insert themselves into positions of power in the new regime. Unity and democracy have returned to Mexico, but their prospects are not rosy."
 dvg_gran_colombia.59.a: "Peace at any price is still peace."
 dvg_gran_colombia.60.t: "The Lusitania Gambit"
 dvg_gran_colombia.60.d: "Mexico is not and has never been enough for Santander. It was, like so many parts of his life, a means to an end – in this case, a means of shedding the rotting shell of Vicente’s Colombia and starting over fresh. Santander has no issue with the idea of Colombia, merely the form it took under the traitor Vicente, and the conspiracy which infested it."
 dvg_gran_colombia.60.f: "In fact, he intends to reforge it, except this time according to his will and his alone. Lusitania is the first step. If Santander can crush them, he reasons, then reconquering San Salvador will be simple, and then Colombia will be whole once more. Of course, word of his plan has already leaked out in the scurrilous foreign presses, and the element of surprise has to an extent been lost, but no matter! Santander will crush the despicable Peixoto and remove his green stain of a nation from the map!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.60.a: "Viva el Presidente, viva Santander!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.61.t: "Lusitania est Pacata"
 dvg_gran_colombia.61.d: "As expected, Lusitania has been shattered by Mexican might! Their cowardly forces could not withstand our awesome assault, and we have brought their entire nation back into our fold. Peixoto had tried to flee to Plantagenia but was intercepted at the border and will be brought back to Mexico City – first for a fair trial, and then, once convicted, an equally fair public hanging."
 dvg_gran_colombia.61.f: "As for the Lusitanians themselves, oh, Santander has plans for them, plans to solve their separatist obsession once and for all. In the meantime, San Salvador awaits final redemption, and the President is overjoyed to see the people finally paying him the support he has always deserved. His triumph over Lusitania has convinced many to accept his rule, or at least cease to challenge it. And why should they? He is, after all, the rightful heir of Colombia!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.61.a: "Veni, vidi, vici."
 dvg_gran_colombia.62.t: "The Lusitanian Catastrophe"
 dvg_gran_colombia.62.d: "In a development which most people except Santander himself privately foresaw, the Mexican armies were unable to subdue Lusitania. Santander’s humiliating failure to reconquer the northern separatists has led to the shattering of his national mystique, and his supporters have rapidly abandoned him. General Manuel Diaz, who had long concealed his liberal views, proclaimed the “Plan of Tepic” as soon as he realized the scope of the Mexican defeat."
 dvg_gran_colombia.62.f: "He denounced Santander as a mad, murderous despot, and promised the restoration of democracy and an end to costly foreign adventures in favor of internal rebuilding. With most of the military supporting them, Diaz and his men seized Mexico City with little trouble. Santander was found dead in his bedroom, having taken a knife to himself like the Roman Emperor Nero before him. With his regime of surveillance and oppression dismantled, many liberals have begun to return from exile, eager to build a more peaceful Mexico. Distressingly, Diaz has been acclaimed as the new Mexican President, but he has sworn to rebuild and uphold the rule of law. Even if he does twist democracy in the future, cynics argue, he has little chance of being worse than Santander."
 dvg_gran_colombia.62.a: "And so the Santanderana dies with a whimper."

 dvg_gran_colombia.63.d: "”I leave life to enter history.” – Last words of Agustín de Santander"
 dvg_gran_colombia.63.f: "For the past few years, our esteemed leader Santander has privately struggled with an infection, the consequence of an old Independence War wound. Last night, it caught up with him – having excused himself from dinner due to a sharp chest pain, he died less than an hour later. Santander leaves behind a conflicted legacy, albeit one defended by many fierce supporters. Under his rule, Mexico emerged from the ashes of Colombia and conquered Lusitania when many expected failure. Foreign critics concede that he made Mexico a stronger nation but emphasize the severe costs of his rule in terms of autonomy, personal freedom, and local identities. Now that he has passed, Mexico will face even more of an uphill battle if it wants to reclaim Colombia, but the Santandristas still burn with the fire of their icon’s ambition in their hearts."
 dvg_gran_colombia.63.a: "Vicente was the father of Colombia, but Santander was the father of Mexico."

 dvg_gran_colombia.64.d: "”I leave life to enter history.” – Last words of Agustín de Santander"
 dvg_gran_colombia.64.f: "For the past few years, our esteemed leader Santander has privately struggled with an infection, the consequence of an old Independence War wound. Last night, it caught up with him – having excused himself from dinner due to a sharp chest pain, he died less than an hour later. Santander leaves behind a massive legacy as the man who withstood Colombia’s death and achieved its resurrection. Under his rule, Mexico emerged from the ashes of Colombia and reforged it stronger than before. Even foreign critics concede that he accomplished tremendous feats, and their emphasis of the severe costs of his rule in terms of autonomy, personal freedom, and local identities tends to be disregarded by Colombians. Now that he has passed, thousands upon thousands gather in Mexico City to mourn the man even greater than Herrera, and the spiritual leader of Spanish Arcadia."
 dvg_gran_colombia.64.a: "Vicente was the father of Colombia, but Santander was its Savior."
 dvg_gran_colombia.65.t: "The Death of Santander"
 dvg_gran_colombia.65.d: "”I leave life to enter history.” – Last words of Agustín de Santander"
 dvg_gran_colombia.65.f: "For the past few years, President Santander has privately struggled with an infection, the consequence of an old Independence War wound. Last night, it caught up with him – having excused himself from dinner due to a sharp chest pain, he died less than an hour later. His generals tried to keep the news secret, but it soon leaked out and sparked public celebration, closely followed by massive pro-democracy protests. Rather than spark yet another conflict, most high-ranking Santandristas have fled into exile, paving the way for democracy to establish itself in their place. Santander will forever be known as one of the worst tyrants of the modern era, the destroyer of Colombia and oppressor of Mexico. Foreign critics on both the left and right have rejoiced at the death of an internationally infamous despot. The unitary system which he created will likely be the only monument to his legacy which the vengeful masses do not demolish."
 dvg_gran_colombia.65.a: "Vicente was the father of Colombia, but Mexico is an orphan."
 dvg_gran_colombia.66.t: "The Fate of Santander"
 dvg_gran_colombia.66.d: "”I leave life to enter history.” – Last words of Agustín de Santander"
 dvg_gran_colombia.66.f: "After the recent ousting of President Santander, the new regime arrested and tried him, both to furnish its image and to exorcise the Santanderana from Mexican society. Representing himself, Santander first argued that the trial was illegal as Mexico had no constitution. When the prosecution responded that treason was still criminal, Santander became enraged, accusing the entire court of being part of a vast conspiracy against him, and insisting that everything he did had been to defend Mexico. Witnesses testified about his cruelty, bigotry, and history of paranoid delusions. Towards the end of the trial, he grew prone to sudden outbursts, at one point wailing, “O World, why do you persecute me?” Condemned to death, he was taken to the Mexico City barracks and executed by firing squad. With even reactionaries disowning Santander, many now look with nostalgia towards Anastasio Vicente, who has become a secular saint of Mexican republicanism."
 dvg_gran_colombia.66.a: "Vicente was the father of Colombia, and the grandfather of Mexico."
 dvg_gran_colombia.67.t: "Dawn of a New Mexico"
 dvg_gran_colombia.67.d: "The end of the Santanderana, and the purging of his influence from Mexican politics, has led Mexico and its people to undergo a national rebirth. Freed from the paranoid and violent atmosphere of Santander’s regime, many Mexicans are reconsidering what it means to be a “Mexican.”"
 dvg_gran_colombia.67.f: "Colombian restorationism seems to have given way to a new Mexican nationalism, one founded upon democracy and republicanism. To that end, a constitutional conference has concluded in Oaxaca City, codifying the form of the new government. Santander’s hyper-centralism has been discarded in favor of a federal republic, with rights and responsibilities split between state and federal governments without either dominating the other. The resulting system is far from perfect, but it gives Mexico something it has never had before : an official legal foundation upon which to build a society of law and justice. Nothing makes this clearer than Mexico’s new motto…"

 dvg_gran_colombia.68.d: "”The Prefect does not discuss the acts that the ministry gives to him : he only ensures that they are applied.” - Decree for the Establishment of the New Provinces of Colombia and their Prefects, [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.GetString]"
 dvg_gran_colombia.68.f: "The old system of governors has proven susceptible to corruption and fostered unacceptable levels of regionalism and even separatism. One need only recall the example of Lusitanian Governor Peixoto, who openly associated with Lusitanian nationalists! Thus, Emperor Castro and Minister Mirabal have replaced the entire system. Colombia shall henceforth be administered by prefects chosen by the central government, who will ensure that our laws are implemented across the land. Naturally, this will likely inspire intense resistance from the local elites who have fostered such corruption, so we will also implement a program to beautify public spaces in regional capitals and demonstrate the benefits of the new system."
 dvg_gran_colombia.68.a: "At last, our nation is one body!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.69.t: "The “Two Horns of the Devil”"
 dvg_gran_colombia.69.d: "Minister Mirabal has long deplored the state of Colombian prisons, whose squalid conditions and meager guard pay inspire little vigilance and which often result in escapes. For answers, he has looked to Europe, and his office has now submitted a proposal to establish two new high-security prisons along European lines."
 dvg_gran_colombia.69.f: "One will be constructed on an artificial island within the territory of the Veracruz Arsenal, and the other will be constructed on the Ilhas das Três Marias in the Pacific Ocean. The Veracruz Prison will be designed in the style of a Burgundian “panopticon,” allowing near-constant surveillance of prisoners. The Ilhas das Três Marias will host a penal colony and will be reserved for the most dangerous criminals who cannot be housed on the mainland. Some of Mirabal’s assistants have referred to the planned prisons as the “Two Horns of the Devil” and indeed, for those who consider breaking the law in Colombia, they may take on such implications."
 dvg_gran_colombia.69.a: "The only thing greater than walls of stone are walls of water."
 dvg_gran_colombia.70.t: "The Great Indian Revolt"
 dvg_gran_colombia.70.d: "“I and we well remembered the words and warnings given us by the people of Guaxocingo, of Tlaxcala, of Tlamanalco…that we should beware of entering Mexico, where they would kill us, as soon as they had us inside. Let the curious readers consider whether there is not much to ponder over in this that I am writing. What men have there been in the world who have shown such daring?” - Bernal Díaz del Castillo"
 dvg_gran_colombia.70.f: "The Confiscations were always hated by the rural folk. Peasants of all races vowed to protect their lands by force of arms. Last week, a Colombian Army regiment entered a small Indian village near Yucatec to seize its farms. There they crushed an Indian militia which opposed them and torched the village in revenge. The “Martyrdom of Yucatec” has stirred Indian and peasant militias across central Colombia to rebellion. Regional capitals are now under siege, as the fires of anarchy burn across our heartland."
 dvg_gran_colombia.70.a: "We shall crush them like Cortés!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.71.t: "The Plan of San José"
 dvg_gran_colombia.71.d: "”Article 1. The ancient rights of the Catholic Church and of the peoples of Colombia to their lands and to the organizations through which they are held shall be restored at once. Article 2. Owing to its offenses against liberty and property, the current government shall be dissolved, and its officials dismissed. Article 3. José de Puente-Marquez will be recognized as general in chief of the army…” - Plan de San José, [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.GetString]"
 dvg_gran_colombia.71.f: "Governor of Salvador José de Puente-Marquez, a former royalist who joined Vicente’s forces, has betrayed his masters once again.  De Puente-Marquez has long been rumored to crave power and now he has used the Confiscations as an excuse to launch a rebellion to seize Colombia! His overtures to the Church and to the peasantry, Indian or not, have won him many supporters, adding to his considerable popularity in the south. Once again, we find ourselves divided…"
 dvg_gran_colombia.71.a: "Once a traitor, always a traitor!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.72.t: "The End of the Great Indian Revolt"
 dvg_gran_colombia.72.d: "It was in Yucatec that the Great Indian Revolt began, and so it was in Yucatec where it ended. The leaders of the rebels, a coalition of Indians from across Mexico, fought on long after the rest of their forces had surrendered."
 dvg_gran_colombia.72.f: "Today they were finally killed in a shootout not far from the village where the revolt began. Colombian historians of all ideologies note the irony of an alliance of three Indian peoples being crushed by Hispanic arms, just as Cortés’ forces conquered the Triple Alliance of the Aztecs centuries ago. The revolt has shown us that the natives are still far too estranged from the Colombian identity. Henceforth, a policy of rapid assimilation will be imposed upon all Indian communities, as well as communities descended from escaped African slaves, who lent their strength to the revolt. The natives of Colombia may have just fought their last war to defend their ways of life."
 dvg_gran_colombia.72.a: "1519 is finally complete."
 dvg_gran_colombia.73.t: "The End of the Salvadoran Revolt"
 dvg_gran_colombia.73.d: "José de Puente-Marquez’s tangled life has finally come to an end. He was captured along with many of his generals when his fortified mansion in San Salvador was overrun by government troops."
 dvg_gran_colombia.73.f: "From there he was brought to the capital for trial for high treason. De Puente-Marquez claimed that he was acting in the defense of the common people of Colombia, beset as they are, he alleged, by “the theft of their religion on the one hand, and the theft of their lands on the other.” He also denounced the government for confiscating lands in the name of a free market, only for many lands to be sold off to rich speculators. While he drew supporters from as far afield as Rome and even from Catholic noble families in Japan, in the end the verdict was never in doubt. José de Puente-Marquez’s execution by firing squard also marks the end of Indian autonomy in Colombia, as the government has set forth new assimilationist policies to ensure that this rebellion is the last of its kind."
 dvg_gran_colombia.73.a: "And so perishes the last knight of Colombia."
 dvg_gran_colombia.74.t: "The Assassination of Ernesto II"
 dvg_gran_colombia.74.d: "A second Colombian Emperor has perished by assassins’ hands. Ernesto Jaime Rodrigues de Castro was only a child when his father was assassinated, and once he ascended to the throne he spent his time developing his Empire."
 dvg_gran_colombia.74.f: "He started large building projects, mapped out routes for new railroads, expanded education to his people, and, like his father, worked on improving the imperial army. However, just like his father, he aspired to be an enlightened autocrat wielding a centralized state and was planning to curtail the empire’s “Golden Constitution''. This had infuriated many and while the Emperor was traveling to his family estate, a group of people, identified later as anarchists, ambushed his carriage with a volley of thrown bombs. The assassins would be shot dead by Imperial guards, but the Emperor would succumb to his wounds not long after. He is survived by his wife Maria, a princess of Plantagenia, and his young son Cristobal who shall immediately ascend as Cristobal I."
 dvg_gran_colombia.74.a: "God, spare us from these diabolical murders!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.75.t: "The Death of Cristobal I"
 dvg_gran_colombia.75.d: "Colombia once again mourns the death of its Emperor as now Cristobal I has died, and for the first time in Colombia history not at the hands of an assassin, but due to lung cancer."
 dvg_gran_colombia.75.f: "As Emperor, he left matters of politics to the politicians, only taking part whenever the constitution called for him. He set up a number of imperial charities and frequently visited his people, sometimes even in middle-class outfits. A true patron of the arts, Cristobal sponsored numerous artists and established university scholarship programs with a focus on gifted students from poor families. Yet the epitaph that many ascribed to Cristobal was La Chimenea, or the chimney, due to his constant smoking. Unlike his father and grandfather, his charitable work seems to have finally cemented the idea of the royal family as being fair and just monarchs, and the entire nation mourns his death. Due to the lack of a male heir the throne now passes to Christobal’s daughter who will be the first empress of Colombia, Caterina I."
 dvg_gran_colombia.75.a: "The Emperor is dead, long live the Empress!"
 dvg_gran_colombia.76.t: "The Stabilization of the Colombian Peso"
 dvg_gran_colombia.76.d: "A New Colombian Peso"
 dvg_gran_colombia.76.f: "Success! It seems that stabilizing the Colombian peso has paid off. With the new Colombian peso, we can finally move on from the old Spanish reals to a standardized currency used across Colombia. The Colombian peso will also be our first step into the international market with Colombia as an international power in trades across the Atlantic and the Pacific."

 #Decision
 dvg_colombian_manifest_destiny: "The Northern Frontier"
 dvg_colombian_manifest_destiny_desc: "The territories north of Lusitania used to belong to New Spain during the colonial era before they lost it after wars against Japan. Despite that Japan has lost those territories with the independence of Qingqiu, there are still local Lusitanians living there. We must rectify this wrong, and press our claims on those territories."
 dvg_colombian_settling_the_cordillera_arcadiana: "Settling the Cordillera Arcadiana"
 dvg_colombian_settling_the_cordillera_arcadiana_desc: "The Californian War granted us the regions of Gran Teguayo and Bermejo, colloquially known as the Cordillera Minquillana territories, named after the mountains of western Arcadia. These regions remain quite rural, with few cities outside of the military forts and the old Qingqiuese settlements. While the pacification of various Native tribes and the Xijiao fanatics was arduous, those times are over, and this calm has allowed geologists and botanists to conduct surveys there. If reports are true, then they hold fabulous mineral wealth, as well as excellent farming areas. The new “conservationist” movement is already agitating for several especially beautiful parcels of land to be set aside as national parks, which could enhance our international prestige. Best of all, this frontier is a virgin land, free of the colonial identities of Mexico, Lusitania, California, or Salvador. Let us develop this land, with a railroad linking the coast to Copala, so it becomes the crucible of a new Colombian identity!"
 dvg_stabilize_the_peso: "Mint the Colombian Peso"
 dvg_stabilize_the_peso_desc: "Since the colonial era, all manner of coins, bills, and even more esoteric currencies have been used in Colombian finance. Old Spanish reals (silver coins), once prized the world over for their consistent weight but loathed by accountants for their irregular shape and appearance, still dominate our domestic market. We must bring order to this chaos! Minister of Finance Martim Barbosa has devised a new currency, the Colombian peso, backed by gold and silver deposits in the national treasury. Going forward, all domestic commerce will be required to be conducted with pesos, and all other forms of currency will be phased out. With this, we will stabilize our internal market and end the currency madness."
 dvg_banca_de_colombia: "Create the National Bank of Colombia"
 dvg_banca_de_colombia_desc: "The financial upheavals of the past have shown that we must embrace central banking to avoid being at the mercy of foreign institutions and the whims of the market. Moreover, state banks in nations like Burgundy and Scandinavia have been crucial in backing government projects. Let us create the National Bank of Colombia to act as the primary lender to our government. The law creating this bank will also empower our government to control the banking sector at large, including chartering banks, setting minimum levels of capital, and stipulating that all paper money must be backed by gold or silver in the national treasury. This endow our government with the power to intervene in otherwise catastrophic economic swings, and keep the markets stable. As long as one gigantic chain of bank failures does not occur, of course, but how likely is that to happen?"
 dvg_nominate_mirabal: "Create the Hidalgueria Nacional"
 dvg_nominate_mirabal_desc: "Not all of these men were caught with a dagger in their hand, but they are widely known to be able to sharpen a knife and use it.” - Mirabal upon the arrest of the Democratic Republican Party of Tlaxcala\n\nNo one can deny the Republican credits of Juan Carlos Mirabal : he fought alongside Vicente from the day they landed in Veracruz, and was made Minister of the Interior after the war. However he has grown more conservative, and after the death of Vicente, he allied with Castro to help him solidify power. Mirabal not only kept his post but was granted more power than ever before. Today, his project of a national police (dubbed the Hidalgueria Nacional (National Mounted/Noble Police) by Castro) was approved, giving him the tools to cement unitary rule over the Republic. The protests which have broken out in Lusitania and Salvador shall soon be quelled by the military and the Hidalgueros"
 dvg_prefectos: "The Prefect System"
 dvg_prefectos_desc: "The old federal system is unsuitable for Colombia as it encourages regional warlords from contributing to the country and prevent Colombia from truly unify. Let us establish the prefect system to ensure that government officials are loyal to the state and only the state instead of the local warlords."
 dvg_marquess_oaxaca: "Employ the 12th Marquess of Oaxaca"
 dvg_marquess_oaxaca_desc: "Castro often said that “Diplomacy is only police in a rich costume”, yet, he understood how isolated Colombia was when he took power. After decades of war with Spain, Colombia’s only foreign presence was its permanent consulates in Anvers, Copenhagen, and Rome. Thus he turned to Henrique de Albuquerque-Cortès, son of famed Vicente ally Dom Gaspar de Albuquerque-Cortès.\n\nDom Gaspar was a liberal monarchist who hoped to offer the Colombian crown to the Spanish king after the fall of Lisbon. His son Henrique was left stranded in the metropole after Gaspar escaped to Mexico. Thus the younger Albuquerque-Cortès obtained a minor diplomatic post from King Pedro IV, who sought to play father and son against each other. The young man proved to be a vital asset in reducing Spanish dependency on Paris, working with Burgundy to prevent an Anglois annexation of Atlantia. While Albuquerque-Cortès kept his titles after Pedro IV’s fall, the new king clashed with the Marquess and did not renew his employment.\n\nThe Marquess accepted Castro’s offer on the condition of being reinstated in his properties, leading to several demonstrations and petitions from the Zapotecs of Oaxaca. Despite this, he would lay the foundations of a modern and efficient Colombian Foreign Office, equal to that of the Great Powers."
 dvg_codigo_civil_castro: "The Colombian Civil Code of [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.GetString]"
 dvg_codigo_civil_castro_desc: "”Ever since the Spanish conquest, Colombia has known a prodigious diversity of customs and laws. Independence did not change this fact : the territory of the Fatherland was one, but the nations diverse. Now Colombia breathes, and the Constitution given to her by her Consul, allows her to think of her prosperity. Our task has been to establish a new set of laws to guarantee property and morality, for only private virtues guarantee public virtue.” - Juan Manuel de Guzman’s announcement of the Civil Code\n\nNew civil law codes abounded during the era of Revolutions, such as the German project in 1793 which in turn inspired the Etrurian Civil Code of 1826. With most of Colombia’s laws inherited from the colonial era, Castro tasked jurists led by Minister of Justice Juan Manuel de Guzman to create a unified Civil Code for Colombians. The hope was to unify not only the courts but the nation. While heavily inspired by the Etrurian Code, it was notable for its emphasis on family values and properties while also expanding certain colonial laws across Colombia."
 dvg_concordat_with_rome: "Negotiate a Concordat with the Church"
 dvg_concordat_with_rome_desc: "Colombia may have been founded by Catholics with a history of connection to Rome, but our constitution still guarantees a wide freedom of faith. This has strained the Empire of Colombia’s relations with the Papacy, given our attempt to claim divine right to rule while also permitting other faiths to coexist. To improve his legitimacy in the eyes of the church and avoid escalation with Rome, His Majesty can send a delegation to the Holy See to negotiate. What Ernesto proposes is a compromise between liberal ideas and traditional Christian values. Catholicism will be reaffirmed as the official faith of the Colombian Empire, and the government will grant payment to Catholic priests, but other religions will still be protected by the Crown. The Papacy will surely not dare protest such a benevolent arrangement."
 dvg_imperial_universities: "Develop the Imperial Universities"
 dvg_imperial_universities_desc: "The Royal and Pontifical Universities of Mexico, Mérida, and Guadalajara were casualties of the Independence Wars. As they were run by the Church, most instructors were Spanish loyalists who incurred the wrath of Colombian liberals. Upon independence, they disintegrated into smaller institutions with little renown, while Colombia’s elites either hired tutors for their children or sent them to Europe to study. But if these facilities were to be reformed then they could be the foundation of a modern Colombian university system. Let us restore the old universities as public institutions under state rather than church control, with refurbished campuses and state-of-the-art resources. This will keep Colombian students within Colombia, and cultivate a new intellectual class within our society."
 dvg_liceos: "Create the Liceos"
 dvg_liceos_desc: "”We destroyed everything and it is time we create anew. There is a government with established powers, but what is the rest of the nation but grains of sand? We are masters of our fate but we will not keep it if we do not lay masses of granite upon the soil of Colombia. As Christ built his Church upon the rock of Peter, so we build the future of Colombia upon the liceos.” - Ernesto Castro\n\nEducation in New Spain was reserved to elites and had deteriorated even before the Independence Wars. Many of Vicente’s followers sought to secularize education and create a national system of free public schooling, but Castro was more pragmatic. He created high schools in each provincial capital - dubbed “liceos” after the Greek Lyceum of Antiquity - where young boys would learn military discipline alongside sciences and humanities. While most students came from the local elites, Castro also provided a system of scholarships for the most deserving pupils of the lower classes in the Revolutionary spirit of equality. By the end of the 19th century, all Colombian administrative and military elites would be selected from the liceos’ students, a key step towards a modern schooling system."
 dvg_ferrocarril_imperial_colombiano: "Fund the Imperial Colombian Railways"
 dvg_ferrocarril_imperial_colombiano_desc: "The Colombian government, Castro most of all, has always envied the railways of Europe. Messages take months to travel across the nation, delayed by the agonizing geography of Mexico which almost feels like an active foe of a fast and efficient bureaucracy. Previously, the thought of a Colombian railway network seemed a fantasy, due to the enormous mountains of the Sierra Madre, their very presence a mockery of the idea emanating out like the dark clouds of their volcanoes. Now a group of Mexico City engineers have drafted a plan for a grand new railway using new European techniques and technology. It will start in Veracruz, pass through Mexico while squeezing through the mountains, and terminate in Tepic and San Blas, on the Pacific Coast. Sponsoring this “Ferrocarril Imperial Colombiano” might finally end the communication difficulties that have plagued our administration for decades."
 dvg_ferrocarril_imperial_colombiano_san_salvador: "Fund the Mexico-San Salvador Railway"
 dvg_ferrocarril_imperial_colombiano_san_salvador_desc: "With the Ferrocarril Imperial having proven its worth, it is time for its greatest expansion yet. The dense jungles and formidable terrain of San Salvador brought many conquistadors and colonial bureaucrats to grief. Even today, the land is an archipelago of towns within a sea of dense wildlife that makes development a Herculean struggle. Yet small railways have already been built to transport goods from the interior to the coasts for export. If their gauges can be expanded, they could serve as the foundation for an interior rail network, and connected together by new routes built further inland. It is doubtful that this will be the end of our infrastructure problems in San Salvador, but something must be done. Let our indomitable workers face their greatest trial yet, and lay the final jewel in Colombia’s iron crown!"
 dvg_ferrocarril_imperial_colombiano_california: "Fund the Mexico-California Railway"
 dvg_ferrocarril_imperial_colombiano_california_desc: "The unforgiving peaks of the Sierra Madre Occidental which run along the western Lusitanian coast have been an insurmountable barrier between California and Mexico since the colonial era. Even today, most north-south travel goes by sea rather than land. Developments in infrastructure technology, however, may at last present a solution to this problem. Imperial engineers have submitted plans for a new line to extend the western Lusitanian railways north into California and south into western Mexico. The plans also include a new branch of lines in California proper. This may be the start of a transport revolution in California, with the Ferrocarril Imperial Colombiano acting as the ties by which the north shall be eternally unified with the rest of the nation."
 dvg_ferrocarril_imperial_colombiano_lusitania: "Fund the Mexico-Lusitania Railway"
 dvg_ferrocarril_imperial_colombiano_lusitania_desc: "Compared to the harsh terrain and dizzying peaks of Mexico, Lusitania - at least in part - is an easier land to tame. Its geography still boasts rugged cliffs and mountains, but not on the same scale. The plains of the east, having been pacified, are well-suited to rail construction. This project may at long last solve the divide between eastern Lusitania and Mexico that has endured since the colonial era, which has long hindered regional unity and with it regional development. The Ferrocarril Imperial Colombiano will do what the Spanish Crown could not and make Lusitania indisputably modern and indisputably Colombian!"
 dvg_mexicopolis_caput_novi_mondi: "Mexicopolis Caput Novi Mondi"
 dvg_mexicopolis_caput_novi_mondi_desc: "”The Emperor sought to make Mexico the New Rome : something fabulous, colossal, never seen before. When one walks past the Victory Column, the Chapultepec fountain, or Independence Avenue, his success is difficult to dispute.” - Bartolomeo Las Cases, official biographer of Ernesto Castro\n\nCastro did not come from Mexico, but he recognized its importance and sought to remake it. Working with many architects, he devised plans for a new water supply system while draining and filling what was left of the old lakes to improve hygiene. New monuments to his glory, chief among them the Elephant fountain of Chapultepec built with the bronze cannons stolen to the Qingqiuese and Spanish, wide avenues, and a monumental train station, all required a tremendous work force that was soon found among the political and common convicts sent to penal colonies. Despite continuous funding and effort, the Emperor would die before seeing most of his projects finished."
 dvg_confiscation_castro: "The Law on Indian Corporations"
 dvg_confiscation_castro_desc: "In the days of New Spain, lands were allotted to Indian communities across the colony as corporations held in common by the people. Such agreements were also extended to the Catholic Church to cover their own holdings. After the Independence Wars, the religious corporations became the center of debate but the Indian corporations laid in the background. Now reformers are pushing for the government to abolish the Indian corporations. They argue that transferring the lands to private hands will expand the real estate market and the middle class in rural Colombia while also providing the government with badly needed capital. #red A few radicals in government warn that confiscating the last preserves of the natives could ignite a rebellion, but that is a risk we must take.#"
 dvg_ciudad_victoria: "Veracruz, La Ciudad Victoria"
 dvg_ciudad_victoria_desc: "Veracruz is the most important port city in Hispanic Arcadia. It was here that the fall of the Aztec Empire began : it was here that nearly all of New Spain’s eastward trade was conducted : and it was here where Ernesto Castro gained immortal fame for his military brilliance. Today, Veracruz has also become the main arsenal of the Colombian Navy, and retains its economic importance. But time has been unkind to the city and its current state does not befit its reputation. Let us change this! Several proposals have been received for the redesign of Veracruz, “The City of Victory,” along beautiful European lines like Anvers. Wide boulevards, public parks, new canals, and updated port facilities will restore Veracruz’s status as the jewel of Arcadia. The centerpiece will be a towering statue of the Hero of Veracruz himself in the city square, forged from bronze by the finest Burgundian sculptors."
 dvg_puertoriental: "Establish Puertoriental, Home of the Pacific Fleet"
 dvg_puertoriental_desc: "San Bias is a small port on the coast of Tepic. It was a notable colonial-era port with economic ties throughout the Pacific Ocean, but it sank from relevance during the Independence Wars. Many Mexicans are envious of the prosperous city of Porto Novo to the north, which dominates Pacific trade ever since the decline of Acapulco. Now a group of imperial engineers have reported that San Bias would be an excellent site for a new western Colombian port. The Pacific Fleet needs a new base, after all, and Porto Novo’s facilities are dominated by civilian trade. The remodeling of San Bias is also an opportunity to introduce European-style planning and create a model for Colombian civic beauty - and, of course, reduce Porto Novo’s preeminence. Let us coronate this new western gem Puertoriental!"
 dvg_escuela_normal: "Develop the Normal Schools"
 dvg_escuela_normal_desc: "Colombian education reformers have become fascinated by Burgundy’s “écoles normales”, model schools where student-teachers can learn the arts of pedagogy and curriculum. If this system could be imported into Colombia, then it could establish a state-run educational system entirely separate from the old ways of Church-run schools. A rapid expansion of the teacher base is especially needed in rural areas which have been neglected by urban elites for centuries. By opening such institutions across Colombia, we can train the next generation of educators across a broad section of society and bring teaching outside of urban centers."
 dvg_la_reforma: "Pass the Land Reforms"
 dvg_la_reforma_desc: "In the days of New Spain, lands were allotted to the Catholic Church and Indian communities across the colony as corporations. But many in both New Spain and later Colombia saw such arrangements as folly for taking the lands outside of the market and locking them out of the turn of modernity, not to mention the power they gave the Church. Now reformers are pushing for the government to confiscate these lands. They argue that transferring the lands to private hands will expand the real estate market and the middle class in rural Colombia while also providing the government with badly needed capital. Most of all, it will drive a stake into the heart of the Church’s power in Colombia, as seen by similar efforts in Spain. #red A few radicals in government warn that the Indians and the peasants may resort to violence to protect their lands, but reformers insist that the benefits outweigh the risks.#"
 dvg_nova_lisboa_renovation: "Renovate Nova Lisboa, A Estrela do Nordeste"
 dvg_nova_lisboa_renovation_desc: "Nova Lisboa, the cultural heartland of the Lusitanians of Entre-Tierras, was never destined to exist. When its founders settled near the mouth of the Santo António river, the city quickly developed from a quaint latifundia like dozens of others dotting Lusitania, to one of the busiest settlements of northern Colombia. However, its thin cobbled streets, lack of urban planning, and winding farmer’s estates dotting its outskirts hamper its potential towards becoming Tejas’ foremost city. A large-scale renovation plan has been drafted to bring Nova Lisboa to modernity, with grand avenues leading towards the city’s center, the Palácio dos Governadores, widespread relocation of sporadically built hamlets, and infrastructure expansion with an eye towards future construction. May the Star of the Northeast be reborn just as Colombia has been!"
 dvg_porto_novo_renovation: "Redesign Porto Novo, the Pacific Gate"
 dvg_porto_novo_renovation_desc: "Eastern Colombia has Veracruz - Western Colombia has Porto Novo. After the Great Migration of Californian settlers during the conflicts with Japan and later Qingqiu, the city quickly grew to rival Acapulco, Colombia’s previous foremost western port. Compared to the southern city, its terrain was far less treacherous. Many merchants who were unsuccessful in Acapulco moved north to Porto Novo, and the city also benefited from becoming the new gateway to northwestern Arcadia. But these waves of migration were haphazard and the city’s erratic growth reflected this. It was the invention of the steamer that made Porto Novo the prime hub of Asian-Colombian exchange, with ships now unbound from trade winds. With new status comes a need for a new design! Grand streets, an expanded harbor, and most of all, the development of the bayside area into a splendid new home for people and businesses, shall make Porto Novo the envy of the Pacific."
 dvg_codigo_civil_vicente: "The Colombian Civil Code of [TimeKeeper.GetCurrentDate.GetString]"
 dvg_codigo_civil_vicente_desc: "New civil law codes abounded during the era of Revolutions, such as the German project in 1793 which in turn inspired the Etrurian Civil Code of 1826. With most of Colombia’s laws inherited from the colonial era, there has always been a strong desire to overhaul the legal system and bring it into modernity. Let us consult the legal codes of Europe and draft new statues to unify not only the courts but the nation. The Etrurian Code, with its rejection of other legal codes’ obsession with property, will make an excellent inspiration to guide Colombia’s laws in a more equal and equitable direction."
 dvg_ciudad_vicente: "The new Federal Capital : Ciudad Vicente"
 dvg_ciudad_vicente_desc: "Few cities are more important in Colombia than Veracruz. It was there that the fall of the Aztec Empire began : it was there that most of New Spain’s eastward trade was conducted : and it was there that Vicente and his vanguard landed in 1827 to initiate the greatest chapter in our heroic struggle for independence. This is the city where Colombia began and it is where the heart of Colombia should lie, through with a new name to honor the father of the country, Ciudad Vicente. Mexico City has served its purpose in nurturing the cause for independence, however the city’s continued use as our capital has made the Mexicans feel as though they are the first among equals in the alliance. For the sake of equality and regardless of how the Mexicans feel we must make sure our new capital lies in Ciudad Vicente."
 dvg_mexico_vicente: "The Renovation of Mexico"
 dvg_mexico_vicente_desc: "To any inhabitant of Colombia, Mexico City is practically inseparable from the wider Colombian identity, affixed to it since the earliest colonial days - and for hundreds of years before that for its native inhabitants.\n\nOur efforts towards the decentralization of economic and cultural power away from the mother of all colombian cities have borne fruit, many of Mexico City’s urban poor and other individuals have chosen to resettle in the various corners of our state, much to the chagrin of centralists. However, its position as the beating cultural heart of Gran Colombia and Entre-Tierras shall not be disputed in our time, and such a revalorization process, architectural first and foremost, will seek to lay bare the city’s ancient past, a true jewel in a Mesoarcadian-Hispanic cultural continuum, hundreds of years in constant change."
 dvg_fonseca_bay_development: "Develop San Lorenzo de Fonseca"
 dvg_fonseca_bay_development_desc: "The Gulf of Fonseca, which by all rights ought to be perfect for a port, has attracted interest for decades. However, the volcanoes flanking it have stymied government officials, private investors, and peasant settlers alike. While disparate villages exist on the different corners of the Bay, belonging to different jurisdictions, the region never prospered and remained relatively isolated from the rest of San Salvador. However, with Pacific trade booming and a few years past the last Cosigüina’s eruption in 1859, large-scale plans are being drawn up. They envision San Lorenzo de Fonseca, located in a fertile estuary and near the geographic center of the Gulf, being transformed into a modern port and bustling city. To this end, we will incentivize migration into San Lorenzo with land grants and leases, the construction of a truly modern port and the foundations of what will no doubt become another jewel in our western crown!"
 dvg_galapagos_national_park: "Create the Galapagos National Park"
 dvg_galapagos_national_park_desc: "The Galapagos are a very beautiful place worthy of its old name of the Enchanted Isles. With the opening of the Andagoya Canal we have an opportunity to create a premier tourist destination for both our citizens and tourists. At the same time, a small but vocal group of explorers, inspired by similar movements elsewhere in the New World, have formed a “conservationist” association which has called upon us to set aside certain areas of our nation for the usage and enjoyment of future generations. To accomplish this we will have to demolish any existing naval facilities on the islands to make way for civilian facilities to support the creation of the Galapagos National Park. Any existing naval bases will be relocated to Limón which will become the new base to protect the Andagoya Canal."
 dvg_galapagos_naval_base: "Develop the Galapagos Naval Base"
 dvg_galapagos_naval_base_desc: "With the opening of the Andagoya Canal our greater naval strategy. The Galapagos islands lie a good distance south of the canal and would make a great naval base, immune to seizure by enemy armies without the help of an enemy fleet. Establishing a naval base here would greatly extend our reach into the Pacific and help to solidify our influence in Western Ameriga. Establishing a base here would most likely harm the local environment of the islands, but what’s more important? The safety of the country or the safety of some tortoises? In the end we're sure our zoos will be delighted to relocate and study the tortoises."
 dvg_afro_latinos_citizens: "Integration of the Former Slaves"
