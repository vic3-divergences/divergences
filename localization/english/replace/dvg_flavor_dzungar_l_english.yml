 dvg_dzungaria.1.t: "The Khanate"
 dvg_dzungaria.1.d:  "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is the last great remnant of the Mongolian Empire. Founded by Oirat Mongols, in the XVIIth century it grew in importance in the following century unifying the Mongolian camps and vainquishing the Manchus during several campaigns."
 dvg_dzungaria.1.f: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] converted to Islam following his conquests of Samarkand and Khiva but has shown tolerance towards the Buddhists lamas of his realm. While already aged he has said he wanted to advance into China but already his sons want to divide the khanate following their desires."
 dvg_dzungaria.1.a: "We will lead the Steppes peoples to greatness!"
 
 dvg_dzungaria.2.t: "The Death of Galdan Khan"
 dvg_dzungaria.2.d: "The supreme chief of the Asian steppe died yesterday at the venerable age of 76 years."
 dvg_dzungaria.2.f: "The size of the ate combined with the ambitions of his sons has seen the Empire already divided  each army pledging an oath to a different son. The heir Tushiyetu has seized the crown lands of Dzungaria but he now must choose: will he try to stop his brothers’ ambition or will he completely let the Empire disrupt?"
 dvg_dzungaria.2.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Must Stay Together."
 dvg_dzungaria.2.b: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] should only be ruled by people from [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_MGL').GetName]"
 dvg_dzungaria.2.c: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_UZB').GetName] shall rule its rightful steppes once more!"
 dvg_dzungaria.2.ab: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_KAZ').GetName] can only be rule by Kazakhs!"
 dvg_dzungaria.2.ac: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_XIN').GetName] will finally achieve independence!"
 
 dvg_dzungaria.3.t: "The Khanate Stays Strong"
 dvg_dzungaria.3.d:  "The worries that the new heir would not be respected have turned out to be mostly false. "
 dvg_dzungaria.3.f: "If anything, the recent territorial acquisitions of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has shown that the hopes of becoming a great empire have not faded away."
 dvg_dzungaria.3.a: "Let's establish a new Khanbaliq!"


 dvg_dzungaria.4.t: "The Khanate's Religion"
 dvg_dzungaria.4.d:  "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s geographic position puts it at a crossroads to two very different religions - Buddhism and Islam."
 dvg_dzungaria.4.f: "As [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] himself converted to Islam, he has so far been reluctant to enforce it as a state religion. Many Mongols and Chinese have been devout Buddhists ever since Kublai Khan conquered China with the subsequent Yuan Dynasty. As the religion has always been more compatible with conventional Mongol shamans, much  of the nobility in the Mongol heartland to this day believe there are reincarnations of living Buddhas within their families. This is no coincidence either - [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_TIB').GetName]'s leadership under the Dalai Lama is thanks to our interference and in return [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_TIB').GetName] was among the first nations to recognize Dzungar hegemony in the region. \n\n  However, Islam still remains popular among the other ethnic groups that make up a greater share within our realm - the Uzbeks, Tajiks, Uighurs, Kazakhs, among others. Changing the khanate's state religion isn't unprecedented - The khans of the Chagatai, Ilkhanate, and Golden Horde converted to Islam with respect to their governed populations."
 dvg_dzungaria.4.a: "Like Kublai Khan and how Dzungars have always been, we will remain a Buddhist nation."
 dvg_dzungaria.4.b: "Like the Khans of the west, we shall embrace Islam. Insha'Allah, let us keep the steppes united!"

 dvg_dzungaria.5.t: "Around the Great Wall"
 dvg_dzungaria.5.d: "Following the expulsion of its the old Mongol rulers centuries prior, the Ming dynasty rebuilt sections of the Great Wall to prevent further invasions. Yet, as our victories have shown, this proved to be utterly ineffective."
 dvg_dzungaria.5.f: "  "Just like our ancestors before, we knew that wall could not go on forever. There had a to be a weak point somewhere. Alas, we found the western end and headed straight into their heartland - to show them who they have been really afraid of."  - [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]  "
 dvg_dzungaria.5.a: "Let's establish a new Khanbaliq!"
 dvg_dzungaria.5.b: "We are ever closer to establishing a new Yuan Dynasty!"

 dvg_dzungaria.6.t: "The New Golden Horde"
 dvg_dzungaria.6.d: "Centuries ago, the Russian princes paid fealty to the Mongol Khagan. Now, the Mongols are back."
 dvg_dzungaria.6.f: "Already, word is spreading of the return of an impending doom crossing the Ural mountains that could threaten all of Europe."
 dvg_dzungaria.6.a: "The western princes shall be subjugated once more!"
 dvg_dzungaria.6.b: "Sooner or later they will all return to Mongol rule."

 
 dvg_dzungaria.7.t: "The Gelugpa Nation"

 dvg_dzungaria.7.f: "As the Dalai Lama stepped onto the Mongolian soil, a palpable sense of anticipation filled the air. The vast landscape echoed with the serene chants of Buddhist monks, resonating with the spiritual essence that both Mongolia and Tibet shared. A colorful sea of traditional Mongolian attire adorned the crowd that gathered to welcome the revered spiritual leader. The union of two ancient cultures, steeped in spiritual heritage, created a moment of harmony as the Dalai Lama and the Mongolian people embarked on a shared journey of spiritual enlightenment and cultural exchange."
 dvg_dzungaria.7.a: "Peace and Hegemony!"

 
 dvg_dzungaria.8.t: "The Greater Gelugpa Nation"
 dvg_dzungaria.8.d:  "Seeing greater potential in being united rather than divided, [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_DZU').GetName] has embraced the Dalai Lama and his realm."
 dvg_dzungaria.8.f: "As the Dalai Lama stepped onto the Mongolian soil, a palpable sense of anticipation filled the air. The vast landscape echoed with the serene chants of Buddhist monks, resonating with the spiritual essence that both Mongolia and Tibet shared. A colorful sea of traditional Mongolian attire adorned the crowd that gathered to welcome the revered spiritual leader. The union of two ancient cultures, steeped in spiritual heritage, created a moment of harmony as the Dalai Lama and the Mongolian people embarked on a shared journey of spiritual enlightenment and cultural exchange."

 dvg_dzungaria.9.d:  "Currently, our Muslim bretheren in  [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_XIB').GetName] are subjects of  [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SHU').GetName] "
 dvg_dzungaria.9.f: "However, it is no secret that the Muslim and Mongol-speaking [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_XIB').GetAdjective] people do not want to live continually disenfrancchised under the rule of the Shun's exploitative rule. Maybe we can provoke them into a revolt with the  [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SHU').GetName]. "

 dvg_dzungaria.10.d:  "Currently, our Muslim bretheren in  [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_DZU').GetName] suggest that we revolt against the [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SHU').GetName], promising to aid us with we do."
 dvg_dzungaria.10.f: "It is no secret they are not doing this out of the kindness of their heart though. [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_DZU').GetAdjective] interests are better served from a weakened, destabilized [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SHU').GetName]. However, we might have some leeway in determining our post-independence arrangement."
 dvg_dzungaria.10.a: "We will revolt under  [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_DZU').GetName] protection!"
 dvg_dzungaria.10.b: "[SCOPE.sCountry('scope_XIB').GetName] shall know sovereignty!"
 dvg_dzungaria.10.c: "We cannot risk the ire of [SCOPE.sCountry('scope_SHU').GetName]!"
