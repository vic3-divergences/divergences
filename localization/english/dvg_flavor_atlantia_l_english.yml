 dvg_atlantia.10.t: "The Golden Board of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_atlantia.10.d: "As the circumstances around it change, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] finds itself at a crossroads."
 dvg_atlantia.10.f: "Initially a part of Burgundian Lotharingia, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was later seized by Anglois forces and was later ceded to Spanish control as a neutral buffer state. Under Spanish rule, a 'Golden Board' was established due to discovery of gold in the area and the consequential destabilizing impact on the global economy. This board hosts Anglois, Burgundian, and Spanish delegations while excluding Amazoniens and Lotharians. This status quo is unlikely to last forever though, as Atlantia's gold dwindles and Spain finds itself in constant conflict elsewhere. Atlantia's neighbors are also aware of the potential future as well and have even sent members of their populace to help influence local politics. At the same time however, many Atlantians have developed their own distinguishable culture and may even seek a sovereign, independent Atlantia."
 dvg_atlantia.10.a: "The future is so far yet so near."
 
 dvg_atlantia.1.t: "The Future of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]"
 dvg_atlantia.1.d: "The time has come to decide who should govern [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 dvg_atlantia.1.f: "For decades now, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has remained relatively peaceful as a buffer state between [SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName] under Spanish sovereignty. However, there are an increasing amount of Atlantians seeking a different future. \n \n If we refuse to join [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName], there is a good chance their armed forces will try to pillage and raze us. We could join [SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName] for protection as they are more liberal minded like many Atlantians are, but joining them would effectively disenfranchise our Black populace due to attitudes there regarding race. Of course, we could just decide to join neither, but we might not be prepared for a future invasion from either of them."
 dvg_atlantia.1.f2: "For decades now, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has remained relatively peaceful as a buffer state between Amazonie and [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName] under Spanish sovereignty. However, there are an increasing amount of Atlantians seeking a different future. \n \n With the country known as Amazonie no longer existing, we can now only choose to join [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName] or be independent. If we refuse to join [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName], there is a good chance their armed forces will try to pillage and raze us. Of course, we could just decide to be independent, but we might not be prepared for a future invasion from them."
 dvg_atlantia.1.a: "We should join [SCOPE.sCountry('ama_scope').GetName]!"
 dvg_atlantia.1.b: "We should join [SCOPE.sCountry('lot_scope').GetName]!"
 dvg_atlantia.1.c: "We should become independent!"
 
 dvg_atlantia.2.t: "A Victory for Liberty"
 dvg_atlantia.2.d: "After much deliberation, the Atlantians have decided to join our fledgling democracy instead of the tyrannical rule of their former masters."
 dvg_atlantia.2.f: "It is unlikely De Aigle will respect this, as he is already accusing the Atlantian referendum of being rigged, not that we would know anything of course. \n \n Already, he is sending troops to our border as to assert Lotharingian hegemony on the continent. It is likely we are outmanned and outexperienced given many of Lotharingia's soldiers are civil war veterans. Can we really beat them?"
 dvg_atlantia.2.a: "Vive la Democratie! Right gives us might!"
 dvg_atlantia.2.b: "Let's not invite a fight we cannot win."
 
 dvg_atlantia.3.t: "The Return of the Golden Province"
 dvg_atlantia.3.d: "After much deliberation, the Atlantians have decided to rejoin our republic once more."
 dvg_atlantia.3.f: "It seems like nothing beats the power of threatening violence if you don't get your way, we would know very well of course."
 dvg_atlantia.3.a: "Vive la Republique!"
 dvg_atlantia.3.b: "On second thought, Atlantia is better as a buffer state than under our control."
 
 dvg_atlantia.4.t: "The Rigged Referendum"
 dvg_atlantia.4.d: "Allegedly, the Atlantians voted to join Amazonie as opposed to returning to us or seeking their own independence much to our anguish."
 dvg_atlantia.4.f: "These results are absolutely nonsensical, and was most likely the work of Amazonien agents bribing election officials and manipulating the results. Regardless, we must reconquer our lost land to show that we will purge corruption from the Golden Province!"
 dvg_atlantia.4.a: "Cote du Cafe is Lotharian!"
 dvg_atlantia.4.b: "We have better things to do."
 
 dvg_atlantia.5.t: "Aid from Atlantia?"
 dvg_atlantia.5.d: "The Atlantians are offering us aid in our fight against any attempts of a foreign power to annex us"
 dvg_atlantia.5.f: "Although this might be convenient, the Atlantians seem to be doing this to set us up as a buffer-puppet state for their future ambitions. This aid could really help, but may undermine our sovereignty."
 dvg_atlantia.5.a: "So what? We need all the help we can get."
 dvg_atlantia.5.b: "We can win this fight on our own."
 
 dvg_atlantia.6.t: "Nouvelle Alsace Refuses Aid"
 dvg_atlantia.6.d: "The leaders of Nouvelle Alsace saw through our plan and are not interested in our help."
 dvg_atlantia.6.f: "It seems like if we want to build a united Ameriga, we will have to look for other ways."
 dvg_atlantia.6.a: "At least we're safe though, right?"
 
 dvg_atlantia.7.t: "Integrating Nouvelle Alsace"
 dvg_atlantia.7.d: "Our influence over Nouvelle Alsace has become so effective, they are now essentially under our control and even acclimating to our liberal ways."
 dvg_atlantia.7.f: "Already, Nouvelle Alsace is seeing infrastructure development and freedom they never would have seen under De Aigle's rule. Although this undermines their whole struggle for independence, at least we share a common struggle against autocracy and they can now protect what they have. They can now be safer under better hands."
 dvg_atlantia.7.a: "Vive les Amerigains! Stronger together!"
 
 dvg_atlantia.8.t: "Integrating Atlantia"
 dvg_atlantia.8.d: "Our influence over Atlantia has become so effective, they are now essentially under our control."
 dvg_atlantia.8.f: "Although this undermines their whole struggle for independence, Atlantia has always been eyed for by its neighbors due to its resources. If we don't get to them, somebody else will!"
 dvg_atlantia.8.a: "Vive les Amerigains! Stronger together!"
 
 dvg_atlantia.9.t: "Atlantians supporting Separatists"
 dvg_atlantia.9.d: "We have reason to believe the Atlantians are trying to undermine us. Our spies within Nouvelle Amsterdam have uncovered them sending money, troops, supplies, and training to the Nouvelsatians."
 dvg_atlantia.9.f: "Since we are already trying to unite the country with the current war and Atlantia is effectively siding against us by aiding the enemy, we can take this chance to retake the Golden Province. Are we just gonna let this wasp nest of dissidents do as they please with us? Our armed forces are insisting we stop this."
 dvg_atlantia.9.a: "We have never been about compromise. Atlantia Delenda Est!"
 dvg_atlantia.9.b: "The House of Cards is already pretty difficult to rebuild. We can't add another card of conflict just yet."
 
 dvg_atlantia.11.t: "The Atlantian Referendum"
 dvg_atlantia.11.d: "The contested borderland between Amazonie and Lotharingia is holding a referendum on whether to join its neighbors or seek independence."
 dvg_atlantia.11.f: "Originally, it was part of Lotharingia under Burgundian control, but it was later seized by the Dual Monarchy and put under their Amazonie administration. Eventually, the discovery of gold and the consequent destabilizing impact on the world economy leading it to be put under a 'Golden Board' with Spanish Sovereignty as a compromise. In spite of our recognized independence however, the European colonial powers have refused to give us a seat on this board. Over time, we have sent our people into Atlantia in hopes they will rejoin our nation."
 dvg_atlantia.11.a: "Hopefully these people know what's best for them!"
 
 dvg_atlantia.12.t: "Atlantia chooses independence!"
 dvg_atlantia.12.d: "It seems in spite of our efforts, Atlantia has decided to become its own sovereign state."
 dvg_atlantia.12.f: "Our administraiton is disappointed as they sure could have benefited from our protection as it now won't be as easy to gain access to market. Still, maybe can find a way to make this new country useful to us later."
 dvg_atlantia.12.a: "Let's keep an eye on them so that they don't give us trouble."

 dvg_atlantia.13.t: "Atlantia joins Lotharingia!"
 dvg_atlantia.13.d: "Allegedly the election results have indicated that the Atlantians have decided to join Lotharingia instead of returning to us or seeking their own sovereignty."
 dvg_atlantia.13.f: "Atlantia is a bastion of liberalism, so why wouldn't they join a fellow democracy? Clearly the Lotharingians must have coerced them which means the legitimacy of the referendum is questionable at best. Perhaps we can 'liberate' these poor Atlantians? Lotharingia might be a militarily threatening foe, but are we just going to let them do as they please on the continent?"
 dvg_atlantia.13.a: "The torch of liberty will fly over Nouvelle Amsterdam!"
 dvg_atlantia.13.b: "Let's not fight battles we cannot win."
 
 dvg_atlantia.14.t: "Frédéric Delgrès Seeks Asylum"
 dvg_atlantia.14.d: "Following the integration of Equinoxea, slavery is now legal across all of Amazonie and the government there hopes repatriate and capture escaped ex-slaves. Among them, a prominent abolitionist by the name of Frederic Delgrès hopes to seek asylum in our country."
 dvg_atlantia.14.f: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is a country built by immigrants, but does that include political refugees as well? Frédéric Delgrès is one of the most prominent and divisive orators of his country. Born a slave to a Black man and a Tupi woman, Frédéric Delgrès  he served as a secretary for his master’s wife whom had remarked his intellectual capacities and taught him to read. After years of bondage  he managed to escape and continued his education in the free states of Equinoxia. There he was threatened by his former master who invoked the anti-fugitive laws. Thanks to his connections, he was able to sneak across the border into [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Upon hearing about this however, the Amazonie government has demanded we repatriate him."
 dvg_atlantia.14.a: "We are a beacon of liberty for everyone!"
 dvg_atlantia.14.b: "We cannot risk angering Amazonie. Maybe Lotharingia can have him instead?."
 dvg_atlantia.14.c: "He would cause too much trouble here. He will have to look elsewhere."
 dvg_atlantia.14.e: "Send him back to Amazonie!"
 
 dvg_atlantia.15.t: "Integrating Gouas"
 dvg_atlantia.15.d: "Our influence over Gouas has become so effective, they are now essentially under our control."
 dvg_atlantia.15.f: "Although this undermines their whole struggle for independence, Gouas has always been eyed for by its neighbors due to its geography. If we don't get to them, somebody else will!"
 dvg_atlantia.15.a: "Vive les Amerigains! Stronger together!"

 
 dvg_ameriga.1.t: "The Liberation of Amazonie"
 dvg_ameriga.1.d: "For far too long, Afro-Amerigans and working class Amazoniens have suffered under the Planteur policies to enforce racial segregation and slavery. Today, that ends."
 dvg_ameriga.1.f: " 'By virtue of the power vested in me in this time of actual armed conflict, I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves henceforward shall be free. Upon this act, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind, and the gracious favor of Almighty God. As Christ died to make men holy, many of our soldiers have died to make men free.' \n\n - [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]' "
 dvg_ameriga.1.a: "By this stroke, we have brought salvation! Glory Hallelujah!" 
 
 dvg_ameriga.2.t: "A New United States of Ameriga?"
 dvg_ameriga.2.d: "Thanks to our efforts, the Mid-Atlantic states were able to unify under one country."
 dvg_ameriga.2.f: "The hopes of Pan-Amerigans are ever greater."
 dvg_ameriga.2.a: "Ameriga shall be fully united one day!"

 dvg_ameriga.3.t: "Ameriga The Great"
 dvg_ameriga.3.d: "We have successfully united much of the continent."
 dvg_ameriga.3.f: "The Pan-Amerigan dream has been fulfilled! The rooster of unity cries louder than ever. The beacon of liberty shines brighter than ever. The house of steel is stronger than ever. A new world superpower has emerged!"
 dvg_ameriga.3.a: "Oh my counrty tis of thee..."

 dvg_ameriga.4.t: "The Collapse of Ameriga"
 dvg_ameriga.4.d: "Due to the mismanagement of the newly united country, it has fallen apart to effectively cease to exist."
 dvg_ameriga.4.f: "Seems like it was proabably not a good idea to form a country just to map paint instead of caring about how it's run or the people living there, y'know?"
 dvg_ameriga.4.a: "Bye Bye Ameriga!"

dvg_ameriga.5.t: "South Ameriga Petitions For Annexation"
dvg_ameriga.5.d: "Due to the relative peace between the two countries claiming to be Ameriga, the south has realized it would be better to just join us."
dvg_ameriga.5.f: "The East Coast of Ameriga has now been unified!"
dvg_ameriga.5.a: "Viva Ameriga!
