 BRG_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Burgundy once swore fealty to the Kings of France, but its entertaining of independence was always there. Phillip of Burgundy stopped the entertaining of the notion, and put it into action while carving out a great swathe of land and eventually created the crown and title Rex Burgundicum through force of will and arms. Today Burgundy is much the same, grown slightly to include greater amounts of the Dual Monarchies' land and slight increases in German lands under its direct control.

The current ruler, Peter III Lyapunov has been married to the daughter of Maximillian III Habsburg, ruler of the Commonwealth, under the auspices of the philo-polish boyars.

The Republic has suffered a terrible blow with the loss of the Republic of Pskov, reorganized as a Scandinavian satellite state following the Neva War that ended in 1709. Now the Republic is at a crossroad: It must centralize and reform its institutions, which would anger the princedoms and republics within its borders who rely on ancient privileges. It must deal with the ambiguous status of serfdom, as the southern Russian states are angered by the protection offered to freed serfs. Will Novgorod wear the mantle of Alexander Nevsky and lead Russia towards a new era, perish under the Scandinavian boot, or suffocate by its byzantine politics?"

 MJN_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Mianjin Republic is the centre -in all meanings of the word- of Zhourao. Founded by Christian merchants from Qingqiu, it developed tremendously in the XVIIIth century with the arrival of thousands of Chinese settlers who fled the endemic wars in China. The Republic has withstood assaults from the Red Sultans in the North and established several contacts with the Maori tribes and secured the naval roads to Qingqiu while growing more and more into a proper Little China. However, the rule of the patrician families which hold all the power in the state has provoked a miner's rebellion in the South, leading to the loss of several great towns and mines to the recent League of Yaluo. Mianjin now stands at a crossroad : can they emulate their brethern in Qingqiu to embrace modernity and unite the Zhourao states? Or should the rule of the rich continue without any reform?"
 ZSA_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Sultanate of Zhusha is the oldest Zhourao area of settlement. Zhusha has flourished thanks to their position that allows them to control trade coming from Indonesia. Malay and Chinese traders from South-East Asia have brought islam with them, which allowed one powerful leader to proclaim himself Commander of the Faithful and Sultan. However, all the attempts of the Red Sultans to conquer their southern neighbours have been unsuccessful and the court in Butingshan has grown decadent and increasingly reliant on the Dual-Monarchy, always eager to expand their markets. Will Zhourao manage to shake the status quo? Or should the Red Sultans continue their lives until they are mere puppets of colonial powers?"

Over time, those friendly with the Aboriginals would drop the -man, or barbarian, and they would become just the Hongshan. Though many have converted to islam, the Yalai and other Hongshan tribes of southern Jiangzhou have long been a thorn in the back of Zhusha, with raids being conducted on an almost yearly basis.

Over time, those friendly with the Aboriginals would drop the -man, or barbarian, and they would become just the Hongshan. European influence looms large, as many of the Noongar have converted to Protestantism, a consequence of missionairies and tribal elders looking to gain European weapons and support. The Noongar tribes are the most advanced of the decentralized areas of Zhourao, with them perhaps being only a few more decades from uniting into a confederation, similar to the Guli in the east. However, Burgundy's colony in Cap Weltevree threatens to break them before they can reach such a point."

Over time, those friendly with the Aboriginals would drop the -man, or barbarian, and they would become just the Hongshan. The Yolngu Sultanate is best described as an empire, ruling over a diverse group of tribes, with power emanating from their seat of power in the east. They have become rich off of the trade of gold to the Makassarese in their port, and adopted Islam over the course of the four hundred years of contact since the discovery of Zhourao. Well poised to unite the region, they have been stalled by the unification of the Gunwinyguans, as well as the Nungali Sultanate. Now, at the height of their power, Anglois intervention threatens to spell doom for not only Yolngu, but all three states."

Northern Zhourao is an area of diversity, with the influence of the Makassarese being felt at every level. Islam flows out of their port, just as Gold flows in. The Marra were once seperated into a miriad of tribes and sultanates, however, with the rise of the Yolngu Sultanate to their north, they have united into a federation of Sultans."
